\section{Lévy's First–Order Reflection}\label{sec:first_order}

\subsection{Lévy's Original Paper}\label{sec:levy1960}

This section is based on Lévy's paper \emph{Axiom Schemata of Strong Infinity in Axiomatic Set Theory}, \cite{Levy60a}. It presents Lévy's \emph{principle of complete reflection} 
and its equivalence to the \emph{Replacement Schema} and \emph{Axiom of Infinity} under \sf{S}\footnote{See definition \bref{def:s}.}.

First, we should point out that set theory has changed over the last 66 years and show a few notable differences.
One might be confused by the fact that Lévy treats the \emph{Axiom of Subsets}, which we call \emph{Axiom Schema of Specification}, as a single axiom rather than a schema. He even takes the conjunction of all axioms of \sf{ZF} and treats it like a formula. This is possible because the underlying logic calculus is different. Lévy works with set theories formulated in the \emph{non–simple applied first order functional calculus}. The calculus works with two kinds of variables, one for sets and the other for functions. It contains a substitution rule for functional variables, but doesn't quantify over them, so it is not full second–order logic, see the beginning of \emph{Chapter IV} in \cite{church1996introduction} for details.
We will use the usual first–order axiomatization of \sf{ZFC} as seen in \cite{JechBook}.
It should also be noted that the logical connectives look different. The symbol used nowaday for an universal quantifier does not appear, $\forall x \varphi (x)$ was be written as $(x) \varphi (x)$.
The symbol for negation is ``$\sim$'', implication is written as ``$\supset$'' and equivalence is ``$\equiv$''. We will use standard notation with ``$\neg$'', ``$\then$'' and ``$\iff$'' respectively when presenting Lévy's results.

%The following definitions are not used in contemporary set theory, but they illustrate 1960's set theory mind–set and they are used heavily in Lévy's text, so we will include and explain them for clarity. 
%Generally in this chapter, \sf{Q} stands for an arbitrary axiomatic set theory. % used for general definitions, $u$ is usually a model of \sf{Q}, counterpart of today's the universal class $V$.

\

This subsection uses \sf{ZF} instead of the usual \sf{ZFC} as the underlying theory. % neni to zbytecny?

\begin{definition}{(Standard Complete Model of a Set Theory)}\label{def:scm_q}\\
Let \sf{Q} be an arbitrary axiomatic set theory.
We say that $u$ is a standard complete model of \sf{Q} iff
\bce[(i)]
\item $(\forall \sigma \in \sf{Q})(\langle u, \in \rangle~\models~\sigma)$,
\item ``$u$ is transitive''.
% \item $\forall e \langle x, y \rangle \in e \iff (y \in u \et x \in y)$ % co je $e$? omg je to jinak, je to model vsech axiomu pro vsechny $e$!!! relatiizace do u, e?
\ece 
We write $Scm^{\sf{Q}}(u)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Cardinals Inaccessible With Respect to \sf{Q})}\label{def:levy_inaccessible_q}\\
Let \sf{Q} be an arbitrary axiomatic set theory. We say that a cardinal $\kappa$ is inaccessible with respect to theory \sf{Q} iff
\begin{equation}
Scm^{\sf{Q}}(V_\kappa)\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
We write $In^{\sf{Q}}(\kappa)$.\footnote{To be able to define $V_\kappa$, we need to work in a theory that contains the \emph{Replacement Schema} or any of its equivalents. It should be noted that we don't work in an arbitrary theory \sf{Q}, but in \sf{ZF}, which contains the \emph{Replacement Schema}. 
%$Scm^{\sf{Q}}(V_\kappa)$ in fact says ``\sf{ZF} thinks that $V_\kappa$ is a transitive model of \sf{Q}''.
}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Inaccessible Cardinal With Respect to \sf{ZF})}\label{def:levy_inaccessible}\\
When a cardinal $\kappa$ is inaccessible with respect to \sf{ZF}, we only say that it is inaccessible. We write $In(\kappa)$ instead of $In^{\sf{ZF}}(\kappa)$.
\end{definition}
The above definition of inaccessibles is used because it doesn't require the \emph{Axiom of Choice}.

For the definition of relativization, see definition \bref{def:relativization}. The notation used by Lévy is ``$Rel(u, \varphi)$'', we will stick to ``$\varphi^{u}$''.
\begin{definition}{($N$)}\label{def:levy_axiom_n}\\
The following is the \emph{Axiom Schema of Complete Reflection Over \sf{ZF}}, denoted $N$. For every first–order formula $\varphi$ in the language of set theory with no free variables except for $p_1, \ldots , p_n$, the following is an instance of schema $N$:
\begin{equation}
\exists u (Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et (\forall p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u)(\varphi \iff \varphi^{u}))\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
%where $\varphi$ is a~formula which contains no free variables except for $p_1, \ldots , p_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(N')}\label{def:levy_axiom_n'}\\
For any arbitrary first–order formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_m$ in the language of set theory with no free variables except for $p_1, \ldots , p_n$, the following is an instance of schema $N'$:
\begin{equation}
\exists u (z \in u \et Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et (\forall p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u)(\varphi_1 \iff \varphi_1^{u}) \et \ldots \et \varphi_m \iff \varphi_m^{u}))\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(N'')}\label{def:levy_axiom_n''}\\
For an arbitrary first–order formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_m$ in the language of set theory with no free variables except for $p_1, \ldots , p_n$, the following is an instance of schema $N''$:
\begin{equation}
\exists u (Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et (\forall p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u)(\varphi_1 \iff \varphi_1^{u}) \et \ldots \et \varphi_m \iff \varphi_m^{u}))\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Let \sf{S} be an axiomatic set theory defined in definition \bref{def:s}.

This is \emph{Theorem 2} in \cite{Levy60a}
\begin{lemma}{($N \iff N'' \iff N'$)}\label{lemma:n_iff_n'}\\
The schemas $N$, $N'$ and $N''$ are equivalent under \sf{S}.
\end{lemma}

We will execute this proof in the theory \sf{ZF}, but the reader should note that we have neither used the \emph{Replacement Schema} nor the \emph{Axiom of Infinity}, 
so for schemas similar to $N$, $N'$, $N''$ but with ``$Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$'' instead of ``$Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u)$'', the proof works equally well.

\begin{proof}

Clearly, $N' \then N'' \then N$. 

Now, assuming $N$ and given the formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$, we will prove $N''$. Consider the following formula:
\beq
\psi = \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^t t = i \et \varphi_i\mbox{.}
\eeq
We will take advantage of the fact that natural numbers are defined by atomic formulas and therefore absolute in transitive structures. 
From $N$, we get such $u$ that 
\beq
Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et (\forall p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u)(\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^t t = i \et \varphi_i \iff \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^t t = i \et \varphi_i^{u})\mbox{.}
\eeq
This already satisfies $N''$.
In order to prove $N'$ from $N''$, let's add two more formulas. Given $p_1, \ldots, p_n$, we denote
\beq
\varphi_{m+1} = \exists u (z \in u \et Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et (\forall p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u)(\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^m \varphi_i = \varphi_i^u))\mbox{,}
\eeq
\beq
\varphi_{m+2}  = \forall z \varphi_{m+1}\mbox{.}
\eeq
So, by $N''$, we have a set $u$ that satisfies $Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u)$ as well as the following:
\beq
(\forall p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u)(\varphi_i \iff \varphi_i^u) \mbox{ for }1 \leq i \leq m \label{eq:levy_th_2_eq_3}\mbox{,}
\eeq
\beq
z \in u \then \varphi_{m+1} \iff \varphi_{m+1}^u\label{eq:levy_th_2_eq_4}\mbox{,}
\eeq
\beq
\varphi_{m+2} \iff \varphi_{m+2}^u\label{eq:levy_th_2_eq_5}\mbox{.}
\eeq
By $Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u)$ and \eref{eq:levy_th_2_eq_3}, we get $(\forall z \in u) \varphi_{m+1}$, % watt? nemel bych reflektovat i $\varphi_{m+1}$ v eq:levy_th_2_eq_3 ?
so together with \eref{eq:levy_th_2_eq_4}, we get $(\forall z \in u) \varphi_{m+1}^u$, exactly $\varphi_{m+2}^u$, so by \eref{eq:levy_th_2_eq_5} we get $\varphi_{m+2}$. 
But $\varphi_{m+2}$ is exactly the instance of $N'$ we were looking for.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}{($N_0$)}\label{def:levy_axiom_n0}\\
Axiom schema $N_0$ is similar to axoim schema $N$ defined above, but with \sf{S} instead of \sf{ZF}. For every $\varphi$, a first–order fomula in the language of set theory with no free variables except $p_1, \ldots , p_n$, the following is an instance of $N_0$:
\begin{equation}
\exists u (Scm^{\sf{S}}(u) \et (\forall p_1, \ldots , p_n \in u)(\varphi \iff \varphi^{u}))\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
%where $\varphi$ is a~formula which contains no free variables except for $p_1, \ldots , p_n$.
\end{definition}

We will now show that in \sf{S}, $N_0$ implies both the \emph{Replacement Schema} and the \emph{Axiom of Infinity}.

\

Let $N_0$ be defined as in definition \bref{def:levy_axiom_n0}, for the \emph{Axiom of Infinity} see definition \bref{def:infinity}.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:n0_implies_infinity}\
In \sf{S}, the axiom schema $N_0$ implies the \emph{Axiom of Infinity}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} % Levy to bere pres V_\lambda \models 
Let $\varphi = \forall x \exists y (y = x \cup \{x\})$. 
This clearly holds in \sf{S} because given a set~$x$, there is a set $y = x \cup \{x\}$ obtained via \emph{Axiom of Pairing} and \emph{Axiom of Union}. Since the sets obtained via these axioms are definable via $\Delta_0$–formulas, they are absolute in transitive structures thanks to Lemma \bref{lemma:delta_0_absoluteness}.
From $N_0$, there is a set $u$ such that $Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$ and $\varphi^{u}$ holds. % TODO upresnit
This $u$ satisfies the conditions required by the \emph{Axiom of Infinity}.
\end{proof}

Lévy proves this theorem in a different way. He argues that for an arbitrary formula $\varphi$, $N_0$ gives us $\exists u Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$ and this $u$ already satisfies the \emph{Axiom of Infinity}. 
To do this, we would need to prove lemma \bref{lemma:scm_s_is_limit} earlier on, we will do that later in this chapter.
%We would need to prove lemma \bref{lemma:scm_s_is_limit}, which will happen later in this chapter, but we don't know that yet. % mozna taky trochu preformulovat

\

Let \sf{S} be a set theory defined in definition \bref{def:s}, $N_0$ a schema defined in definition \bref{def:levy_axiom_n0} and the \emph{Replacement Schema} a schema defined in definition \bref{def:replacement}.
\begin{theorem} 
%In \sf{S} with $N_0$ implies the \emph{Replacement Schema}.\\
%TODO jedno nebo druhe % nebo treti
In \sf{S}, the axiom schema $N_0$ implies the \emph{Replacement Schema}.
%\beq
%\sf{S}, N_0 \vdash \mbox{the \emph{Replacement Schema}}
%\sf{S} \vdash N_0 \then \mbox{the \emph{Replacement Schema}}
%\eeq % nebo S \vdash N_0 \then Replacement % (veta o dedukci?) nebo \sf{S} + N_0 \vdash Repl
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ be a~formula with no free variables except for \\
$x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n$.
%Out goal is to prove
%\beq
%``\varphi\mbox{ is a function}''\then \forall x \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff (\exists q \in x)(\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)))
%\eeq
Let a set~$x$~be given and let $\chi$ be an instance of the the \emph{Replacement Schema} schema for the $\varphi$ given.
We want to verify in \sf{S} that given a formula $\varphi$, the instance of $N_0$ for $\varphi$ implies $\chi$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\chi = \forall x', y', z(\varphi(x', y', p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et \varphi(x', z, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \then y' = z') \\
\then \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff (\exists q \in x)(\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)))
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Since it can be shown that $N_0$ is equivalent to $N'_0$ similar to $N'$ in lemma \bref{lemma:n_iff_n'}, 
there is a set $u$ such that $Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$, $x \in u$ and all of the following hold:
\bce[(i)]
\item $\varphi \iff \varphi^{u}$
\item $\exists y \varphi \iff (\exists y \varphi)^{u}$
% \item $\chi \iff \chi^{u}$
% \item $\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \chi \iff (\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \chi)^{u}$.
\ece
%The above formulas are instances of the $N_0$ schema for $\varphi$, $\exists y \varphi$, $\chi$ and the universal closure of $\chi$ respectively.
%By $N_0$, there exists a set $u$ where all four formulas hold.\footnote{Despite the fact that $N_0$ is defined for one formula, we have just used it for four at once. To make this formally possible, we can either prove that $N_0$ is equivalent to a more general version for any finite number of formulas or we can reflect their conjunction and argue that if $\langle u, \in \rangle~\models~\varphi_1 \et \ldots \et \varphi_n$, then $(\langle u, \in \rangle~\models~\varphi_1), \ldots, (\langle u, \in \rangle~\models~\varphi_n)$.}
From relativization, $(\exists y \varphi)^{u}$ is equivalent to $(\exists y \in u) \varphi^{u}$, together with (i) and (ii), we get
\begin{equation}
(\exists y \in u)\varphi \iff \exists y \varphi
\end{equation}

If $\varphi$ is a~function, %then for every $x \in u$, which is also $x \subset u$ since $u$ is transitive from $Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$,
it maps the elements of~$x$, which are also elements of $u$ due to transitivity of $u$, to elements of $u$. 
From \emph{Specification Schema},
\beq
y = \{ z \in u : (\exists q \in x)\varphi(q, z, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}
\eeq
is a set and a subset of $u$. 
Since $Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$ holds and $y \subset u$, then also $\power{y} \subset u$, so $y \in u$.
%From the following argument, we shall see that $y \in u$. Let $a$ be the least initial segment 
% But because $Scm^{\sf}(u)$, every set in $y$ has a rank, let $a$ be the set of all elements with rank lesser than or equal to the maximal rank among the ranks elements of $y$.  % is it a set?
% Then $\power{a} \in u$, so by transitivity, $y \in u$.
%It is also an element of $u$ because $u$ is a models of \sf{S}. % proc presne?
%we can find $y$, a~set of all images of the elements of~$x$~via $\varphi$. 
That means we have satisfied the \emph{Replacement Schema} – given a function and a set, we have proved that the image of the set via the given function is again a set.
\end{proof} 


\subsection{Contemporary Restatement}

\medskip We will now introduce and prove a theorem that is called \emph{Lévy's Reflection} or \emph{Lévy–Montague Reflection} in contemporary set theory. The only difference is that while Lévy originally reflects a formula $\varphi$ from the universe of all sets to a set $u$ which is a \emph{standard complete model of \sf{S}}, we say that there is a $V_\lambda$ for a limit $\lambda$ that reflects $\varphi$. Those two conditions are equivalent due to lemma \bref{lemma:scm_s_is_limit}.

%\begin{definition}{(Reflection\textsubscript{1})}\label{def:reflection_1}\\ % co spis Levy's reflection principle?
%Let $\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ be a first–order formula in the language of set theory. Than the following holds for any such $\varphi$.
%\begin{equation}
%\forall M_0 \exists M (M_0 \subseteq M \et (\varphi^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)))
%\end{equation}
%\end{definition}

% Note that this is a restatement of both Lévy's $N$ and $N_0$ from the previous chapter\footnote{see \bref{def:levy_axiom_n} and lemma \bref{def:levy_axiom_n0}}. We prefer to call it \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} so it complies with how other axioms and schemata are named. \footnote{We will not use the name $N_0$, because it might be confusing to work $N_0$ and $M_0$ where $M_0$ is a set and $N_0$ is an axiom schema.} 
% Note that the subscript 1 refers to the fact that $\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ is a first–order formula, and since we're using the word ``reflection'' in less strict meaning throughout this thesis, distinguishing between the two just by using italic font face for the schema might cause confusion.

% We will now prove the equivalence of \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} with the \emph{Replacement Schema} and the \emph{Axiom of Infinity} in \sf{S} in two parts. First, we will show that \emph{First–order reflection} is a theorem of \sf{ZFC}, then we shall show that the second implication, which proves the \emph{Axiom of Infinity} and the \emph{Replacement Schema} from \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema}, also holds.

% The following lemma is usually done in two parts, the first being for one formula, the other for $n$ formulas. We will only state and prove the more general version.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:reflection_lemma}\
Let $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ be first–order formulas in the language of set theory, all with $m$ free variables
\footnote{For formulas with a different number of free variables, take for $m$ the highest number of parameters among those formulas. Add spare parameters to every formula that has less than $m$ parameters in a way that preserves the last parameter, which we will denote $x$.
E.g. let $\varphi'_i$ be the a~formula with $k$ parameters, $k < m$. Let us set $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x) = \varphi'_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{k-1}, x)$, notice that the parameters $p_k, \ldots, p_{m-1}$ are not used.}.
\bce[(i)]
\item For each set $M_0$ there is such set $M$ that $M_0 \subset M$ and the following holds for every $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$:
\begin{equation}\label{equation:refl_lemma_i}
\exists x \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x) \then (\exists x \in M) \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M$.

\item Furthermore, there is a limit ordinal $\lambda$ such that $M_0 \subset V_\lambda$ and the following holds for each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$:
\begin{equation}\label{equation:refl_lemma_ii}
\exists x \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x) \then (\exists x \in V_\lambda) \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M$.

\item Assuming \emph{Choice}, there is $M$, $M_0 \subset M$ such that \eref{equation:refl_lemma_i} holds for every $M,\ i \leq n$ and $|M| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$.
\ece
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will simultaneously prove statements (i) and (ii), denoting $M^T$ the transitive set required by part (ii).
Steps in the construction of $M^T$ that are not explicitly included are equivalent to steps for $M$.

Let us first define an operation $H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1})$ that yields the set of $x$'s with minimal rank\footnote{Rank is defined in definition \bref{def:rank}.} satisfying $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}$ and for every $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$.

\begin{equation}
H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_n) = \{x \in C_i: (\forall z \in C)(rank(x) \leq rank(z))\}
\end{equation}
for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, where
\begin{equation}
C_i = \{x: \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)\} \mbox{ for $1 \leq i \leq n$}\mbox{.}
\end{equation}

Next, let us construct $M$ from given $M_0$ by induction.:
\begin{equation}
M_{i+1} = M_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^{n} \bigcup \{H_j(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}): p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M_i\}
\end{equation}
In other words, in each step we include into the construction the elements satisfying $\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}$ from the previous step.
For statement (ii), this is the only part that differs from (i). To end up with a transitive $M$, we need to extend every step to its transitive closure transitive closure of $M_{i+1}$ from (i). In other words, let $\gamma$ be the smallest ordinal such that 
\begin{equation}
(M^T_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^{n} \{\bigcup\{H_j(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}): p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M_i\}\}) \subset V_\gamma
\end{equation}
Then the incremental step is
\begin{equation}
M^T_{i+1} = V_\gamma
\end{equation}
and the final $M$ is obtained by joining the previous steps.
\begin{equation}
M = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} M_i, \mbox{  }M^T = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} M^T_i = V_\lambda\mbox{ for some limit }\lambda\mbox{.}
\end{equation}

We have yet to finish part (iii).
Let's try to construct a~set $M'$ that satisfies the same conditions like $M$ but is kept as small as possible. Assuming the Axiom of Choice, we can modify the construction so that the cardinality of $M'$ is at most $|M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$. Note that the size of $M$ in the previous construction is determined by the size of $M_0$ and, most importantly, by the size of $H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1})$ for every $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ in individual iterations of the construction. Since (i) only ensures the existence of an~$x$~that satisfies $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for any $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, we only need to add one $x$ for every set of parameters but $H_i(u_1, \dots, u_{m-1})$ can be arbitrarily large. Let $F$ be a~choice function on $\power{M'}$. Also let $h_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}) = F(H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}))$ for $i$, where $1 \leq i \leq n$, which means that $h$ is a~function that outputs an~$x$~that satisfies $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for $i$ such that $1 \leq i \leq n$ and has minimal rank among all such sets. The induction step needs to be redefined to
\begin{equation}
M'_{i+1} = M'_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^n \{ h_j(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}): p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M'_i \}
\end{equation}
This way, the amount of elements added to $M'_{i+1}$ in each step of the construction is the same as the amount of $m$–tuples of parameters that yielded elements not included in $M'_i$. It is easy to see that if $M_0$ is finite, $M'$ is countable because it was constructed as a countable union of sets that are themselves at most countable. If $M_0$ is countable or larger, the cardinality of $M'$ is equal to the cardinality of $M_0$.\footnote{It can not be smaller because $|M'_{i+1}| \geq |M'_i|$ for every $i$. It may not be significantly larger because the maximum of elements added is the number of $n$–tuples in $M'_i$, which is of the same cardinality as $M'_i$.}
Therefore $|M'| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$
\end{proof}

%Before we start, note that the following holds for any set $M$ if $\varphi$ is an atomic formula(x1 \in x2 or x1 = x2), as a direct consequence of relativisation to $M, \in$\footnote{See definition \bref{def:relativization}.

Let's now prove (i) for a given $\varphi$ via induction by complexity. We can safely assume that $\varphi$ contains no quantifiers besides ``$\exists$'' and no logical connectives other than ``$\neg$'' and ``$\et$''.
Let $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ be all subformulas of $\varphi$. Then there is a set $M$, obtained by the means of lemma \bref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, for all of the formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$. 

Let's first consider atomic formulas in the form of either $x_1 = x_2$ or $x_1 \in x_2$. % preformulovat trochu
It is clear from relativisation\footnote{See definition \bref{def:relativization}. This only holds for relativization to $M, \in \cap M \times M$, as opposed to $M, R$ for an arbitrary $R$.} that \eref{equation:levy_theorem_i} holds for both cases, $(x_1 = x_2)^M \iff (x_1 = x_2)$ and $(x_1 \in x_2)^M \iff (x_1 \in x_2)$.

\

We now want to verify the inductive step. First, take $\varphi = \neg \varphi'$. From relativization, we get $(\neg \varphi')^M \iff \neg (\varphi'^M)$.
Because the induction hypothesis tells us that $\varphi'^M \iff \varphi'$, the following holds:
\begin{equation}
(\neg \varphi')^{M} \iff \neg (\varphi'^M) \iff \neg \varphi'
\end{equation}

The same holds for $\varphi = \varphi_1 \et \varphi_2$. From the induction hypothesis, we know that $\varphi_1^M \iff \varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2^M \iff \varphi_2$, which together with relativization for formulas in the form of $\varphi_1 \et \varphi_2$ gives us
\begin{equation}
(\varphi_1 \et \varphi_2)^M \iff \varphi_1^M \et \varphi_2^M \iff \varphi_1 \et \varphi_2
\end{equation}

Let's now examine the case when $\varphi = \exists x \varphi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)$. The induction hypothesis tells us that $\varphi'^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \iff \varphi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)$,
so, together with above lemma \bref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff \exists x \varphi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \in M) \varphi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \in M) \varphi'^M (p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \varphi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x))^M \\
\iff \varphi^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
Which is what we wanted to prove for part (i). %\eref{equation:levy_theorem_i} holds for all subformulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ of a given formula $\varphi$.

\

%So far we have proved part (i) of this theorem for one formula $\varphi$. 
We now need to verify that the same holds for any finite number of formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$. 
This has in fact been already done since lemma \bref{lemma:reflection_lemma} gives us a set $M$ for any finite amount of formulas and given $M_0$. We can therefore find a set $M$ for the union of all of their subformulas. When we obtain such $M$, it should be clear that it also reflects every formula in $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$.

\

Since $V_\lambda$ is a~transitive set, by proving (iii) we also satisfy (ii). To do so, we only need to look at part (ii) of lemma \bref{lemma:reflection_lemma}. All of the above proof also holds for $M = V_lambda$. 

To finish part (iv), we take $M$ of size $\leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$, which exists due to part (iii) of lemma \bref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, the rest being identical.

The two following lemmas are based on \cite{DrakeBook}, \emph{Chapter 3, Theorem 1.2}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:extensionality_in_transitive} % Drake ch.3 Theorem 1.2
If $M$ is a transitive set, then $\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\mbox{\emph{Axiom of Extensionality}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Given a transitive set $M$, we want to show that the following holds.
\beq
\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\forall x, y (x = y \iff \forall z (z \in x \iff z \in y))
\eeq 
Given arbitrary $x, y \in M$, we want to prove that, 
\beq
\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~(x = y \iff \forall z (z \in x \iff z \in y))\mbox{.}
\eeq
According to definition \bref{def:satisfaction}, this is equivalent to
\beq
\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~x = y \mbox{ iff } \langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\forall z(z \in x \iff z \in y)\mbox{,}
\eeq 
which is the same as
\beq
x = y \mbox{ iff } \langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\forall z(z \in x \iff z \in y)\mbox{.}
\eeq
So all elements of~$x$~are also elements of $y$ in $M$, and vice versa. 
Because $M$ is transitive, all elements of~$x$~and $y$ are in $M$, 
so
\beq \langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\forall z(z \in x \iff z \in y)
\eeq
holds iff $x$ and $y$ contain the same elements and are therefore equal.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:foundation_in_transitive}
If $M$ is a transitive set, then $\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\mbox{\emph{Axiom of Foundation}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We want to prove the following:
\beq
\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~\forall x (x \neq \emptyset \then (\exists y \in x) (x \cap y = \emptyset))
\eeq

Given an arbitrary non–empty $x \in M$ let's show that
\beq
\langle M, \in \rangle~\models~(\exists y \in x) (x \cap y = \emptyset)\mbox{.}
\eeq

Because $M$ is transitive, every element of~$x$~is an element of $M$. Take for $y$ the element of~$x$~with the lowest rank\footnote{Rank is defined in definition \bref{def:rank}.}. It should be clear that there is no $z \in y$ such that $z \in x$, because then $rank(z) < rank(y)$, which would be a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Let \sf{S} be a set theory as defined in definition \bref{def:s}. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:scm_s_is_limit}\
The following holds for every $\lambda$:
\begin{equation}
\mbox{``$\lambda$ is a limit ordinal''} \then \langle V_\lambda, \in \rangle~\models~\sf{S}\mbox{.}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Given an arbitrary limit ordinal $\lambda$, we will verify the axioms of \sf{S} one by one.
\bce[(i)]
\item \emph{The existence of a set} comes from the fact that $V_\lambda$ is a non–empty set because a limit ordinal is non–zero by definition.
% Jech 12.10, 12.11

\item \emph{\emph{Axiom of Extensionality}} holds from lemma \bref{lemma:extensionality_in_transitive}.

\item \emph{Axiom of Foundation} holds from lemma \bref{lemma:foundation_in_transitive}.

\item \emph{Axiom of Union}:\\
Given any $x \in V_\lambda$, we want verify that $y = \bigcup x$ is also in $V_\lambda$. Note that $y = \bigcup x$ is a $\Delta_0$–formula.
\beq
y = \bigcup x \mbox{ iff } (\forall z \in y)(\exists q \in x) z \in q \et (\forall z \in x)(\forall q \in z) q \in y
\eeq
So by lemma \bref{lemma:delta_0_absoluteness},
\beq
% y = \bigcup x \iff (y = \bigcup x)^{V_\lambda}
y = \bigcup x \mbox{ iff } \langle V_\lambda, \in \rangle~\models~y = \bigcup x\mbox{.}
\eeq
% asi ok ^

\item \emph{Axiom of Pairing}: \\
Given two sets $x, y \in V_\lambda$, we want to show that $z = \{x, y\}$ is also an element of $V_\lambda$.
\beq
z = \{x, y\} \mbox{ iff } x \in z \et y \in z \et (\forall q \in z)(q = x \lor q = y)\mbox{.}
\eeq
So $z = \{x, y\}$ is a $\Delta_0$–formula, and thus by lemma \bref{lemma:delta_0_absoluteness} it holds that
\beq
%z = \{x, y\} \iff (z = \{x, y\})^{V_\lambda}
z = \{x, y\} \mbox{ iff } \langle V_\lambda, \in \rangle~\models~z = \{x, y\}\mbox{.}
\eeq
% asi ok ^


\item \emph{Axiom of Power Set}: \\
%\begin{equation}
%\forall x \exists y \forall z (z \subseteq x \iff z \in y)
%\end{equation}
Given any $x \in V_\lambda$, we want to make sure that $\power{x} \in V_\lambda$. Let $\varphi(y)$ denote the formula $y \in \power{x} \iff y \subset x$.
According to definition \bref{def:subset}, $y \subset x$ is $\Delta_0$, so for any given $x, y \in V_\lambda$,
\beq
y = \power{x} \iff \langle V_\lambda, \in \rangle~\models~y = \power{x}\mbox{.}
\eeq
Because $\lambda$ is limit and $rank(\power{x}) = rank(x)+1$, we know that $\power{x}~\in~V_\lambda$ for every $x \in V_\lambda$.
% cajk

\item \emph{Specification Schema}: \\ %zkontrolovat, podle Draka, pripadne Jech 12.11
Given a first–order formula $\varphi$, we want to show the following:
\beq
\langle V_\lambda, \in \rangle~\models~\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff z \in x \et \varphi(z, p_1, \ldots, p_n))\mbox{.}
\eeq
Given any~$x$~along with parameters $p_1, \ldots, p_n \in V_\lambda$, we set
\beq
y~=~\{z~\in~x~:~\varphi^{V_\lambda}(z, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}\mbox{.}
\eeq
From transitivity of $V_\lambda$ and the fact that $y \subset x$ and $x \in V_\lambda$, we know that $y \in V_\lambda$, so 
\beq 
\langle V_\lambda, \in \rangle~\models~\forall z (z \in y \iff z \in x \et \varphi(z, p_1, \dots, p_n))\mbox{.}
\eeq

\begin{definition}{(First–Order Reflection Schema)}\label{def:first_order_reflection_schema}\\
For every first–order formula $\varphi$, the following is an axiom:
\begin{equation}
\forall M_0 \exists M (M_0 \subseteq M \et (\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)^M))\mbox{.}

We will refer to this axiom schema as \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema}.

Let the \emph{Axiom of Infinity} and the \emph{Replacement Schema} be as defined in definition \bref{def:infinity} and definition \bref{def:replacement} respectively.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:levy_equivalence_contemporary}
\emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} is equivalent to the \emph{Axiom of Infinity} $ \et $ the \emph{Replacement Schema} under \sf{S}.
\end{theorem}
% lemma:model_of_s?
\begin{proof}
Since theorem \bref{theorem:first_order_reflection} already gives us one side of the implication, we are only interested in showing the converse which we shall do in two parts:
\bce[(i)]
\item $\bold{\emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} \then the \emph{Axiom of Infinity}}$

This is done exactly like theorem \bref{theorem:n0_implies_infinity}. We pick for $\varphi$ the formula $(\forall y \in x)(y \cup \{y\} \in x)$, $M_0 = \{\emptyset\}$. From definition \bref{def:first_order_reflection_schema}, there is a set $M$ that satisfies $\varphi$, so there is an inductive set. We have picked $M_0$ so that $\emptyset \in M$ obviously holds and $M$ is the witness for 
\beq
\exists x(\emptyset \in x \et (\forall y \in x)(y \cup \{y\} \in x))
\eeq
which is exactly definition \bref{def:infinity}.

\

\item $\bold{\emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} \then \emph{Replacement Schema}}$

%Given a~formula $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$, we can suppose that if it holds for a given $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n$, it is reflected in a set $M$ \footnote{Which means that for $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$, $\varphi^M(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$.}
%What we want to obtain is the following:
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{gathered}
%\forall x, y, z (\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et \varphi(x, z, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \then y = z) \then\\
%\then \forall X \exists Y \forall y\ (y \in Y \iff \exists x (\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et x \in X ))
%\end{gathered}
%\end{equation}

%TODO OMG FIX! Drake nebo jech nebo Kanamori!
Let's first point out that while \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} gives us a set for one formula, we can generalise it to hold for any finite number of formulas. We will show how is it done for two formulas, which is what we will use in this proof. Given two first–order formulas $\varphi, \psi$, we can suppose that there are formulas $\varphi'$~and~$\psi'$ that are equivalent to $\varphi$ and $\psi$ respectively, but their free variables are different \footnote{This is plausible since we can for example substitute all free variables in $\varphi'$ for $x_0, x_2, x_4, \ldots$ and use $x_1, x_3, x_5, \ldots$ for free variables in $\psi'$, the resulting formulas will be logically equivalent.}. Let $\xi = \varphi \et \psi$, given any $M_0$, we can find a $M$ such that $\xi \iff \xi^M$. It is easy to see that from relativisation, the following holds:
\beq
\varphi \et \psi \iff \varphi' \et \psi' \iff \xi \iff \xi^M \iff (\varphi' \et \psi')^M \iff \varphi'^M \et \psi'^M \iff \varphi^M \et \psi^M
\eeq

Now given a function $\varphi(x, y)$, we know from \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} that for every $M_0$, there is a set $M$ such that $M_0 \subseteq M$ and both
\beq
(\forall x,y \in M)(\varphi(x, y) \iff \varphi^M(x, y))
\eeq 
and
\beq
(\forall x, y \in M)(\exists y \varphi(x, y) \iff (\exists y \varphi(x, y))^M)
\eeq 
hold, the latter being equivalent to 
\beq
(\forall x, y \in M)(\exists y \varphi(x, y) \iff (\exists y \in M) \varphi^M(x, y))\mbox{.}
\eeq
Therefore 
\beq
(\forall x, y \in M)(\exists y \varphi(x, y) \iff (\exists y \in M) \varphi(x, y))
\eeq
holds too.
That means that we have a set $M$ such that for every $x \in M$, if $\varphi$ is defined for~$x$, then $(\exists y \in M) \varphi(x, y)$. 

To show that the \emph{Replacement Schema} holds for this particular $\varphi$, we need to verify that given a set $M_0$, $M'_0 = \{ y : (\exists x \in M_0) \varphi(x, y)\}$ is also a set. But since $M_0 \subseteq M$ and because given any $x \in M$, there is $y \in M$ satisfying $\varphi(x, y)$, the following is a set due to \emph{Specification Schema}:
\beq
M'_0 = \{ y : (\exists x \in M_0) \varphi(x, y)\} = \{ y \in M : (\exists x \in M_0) \varphi(x, y)\}
\eeq
% tranzitivita? V_\lambda?

%We also know that $x, y \in M$, in other words for every $X$, $Y = \{y : \varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}$ and we know that $X \subset M$ and $Y \subset M$, which, together with the specification schema implies that $Y$, the image of~$x$~over $\varphi$, is a~set.

% Stronger reflection:

% asi do dalsi kapitoly
We have shown that reflection for first–order formulas, is a~theorem of \sf{ZFC}. %, which means that it won't yield us any large cardinals. 
We have also shown that it can be used instead of the the \emph{Axiom of Infinity} and the \emph{Replacement Schema} scheme, but \sf{ZFC} + \emph{First–Order Reflection Schema} is no stronger than \sf{ZFC}. 
Besides being a~starting point for more general and powerful statements, it can be used to show that \sf{ZFC} is not finitely axiomatizable. 
This follows from the fact that reflection yields an inner model to any consistent finite set of formulas that hold in $V$.
So if $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ would be the axioms of \sf{ZFC}, reflection would prove that every model of \sf{ZFC} contains a smaller model of \sf{ZFC}, which would in turn contradict the Second Gödel's Theorem. % TODO je to to co delal montague?

It is also worthwhile to note that, in a~way, reflection is dual to compactness. 
% ref http://www.helsinki.fi/sls2015/materials/Fontanella%20Scandinavian%20Summer%20School.pdf
Compactness says that given a set of sentences, if every finite subset yields a~model, so does the whole set. Reflection, on the other hand, says that while the whole set has no model in the underlying theory, every finite subset has a model.
Furthermore, reflection can be used in ways similar to upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem.
Since Reflection extends any set $M_0$ into a~model of given formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$, we can choose the lower bound of the size of $M$ by appropriately choosing $M_0$.

In the next section, we will try to generalise reflection in a~way that transcends \sf{ZFC} and yields some large cardinals.
