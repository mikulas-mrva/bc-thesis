\noindent This thesis aims to examine the relation between the so called Reflection Principles and Large Cardinals. LÃ©vy has shown that the Reflection Theorem is a sound theorem of ZF and it is equivalent to the Replacement Schema and the Axiom of Infinity. From this point of view, Reflection theorem can be seen a~specific version of an Axiom of Infinity. This paper aims to examine the Reflection Principle and its generalisations with respect to the existence of Large Cardinals. This thesis will establish the Inaccessible, Mahlo and Indescribable cardinals and show how can those be defined via reflection. A natural limit of Large Cardinals obtained via reflection are cardinals inconsistent with L. This thesis will offer an intuitive explanation of why this holds.
