\section{Levy's first-order reflection}\label{sec:fixed}

\subsection{Lévy's Original Paper}\label{sec:Levy1960}
This section will try to present Lévy's proof of a~general reflection principle being equivalent to \emph{Replacement} and \emph{Infinity} under ZF minus \emph{Replacement} and \emph{Infinity} from his 1960 paper \emph{Axiom Schemata of Strong Infinity in Axiomatic Set Theory}\footnote{\cite{Levy60a}}.

When reading said article, one should bear in mind that it was written in a~period when set theory was semantically oriented, so while there are many statements about a~model of $\sf{ZF}$, usually denoted $u$, this is equivalent to today's universal class $V$, so it doesn't necessarily mean that there is a set $u$ that is a model of $\sf{ZF}$. We will review the notion of a standard complete model used by Lévy throughout the paper in a moment. Let's first say that the set theory $\sf{ZF}$ was formulated in the "non-simple applied first order functional calculus", is 

TODO viz A. Church nebo tak neco. % math.stackovrflow?

The axioms are equivalent to those defined in \ref{def:zf}, except for the \emph{Axiom of Subsets}, which is just a different name for \emph{Specification}.
Besides $\sf{ZF}$ and $\sf{S}$, defined in \ref{def:zf} and yref{def:s} respectively, the set theories theories $\sf{Z}$, and $\sf{SF}$ are used in the text. $\sf{Z}$ is $\sf{ZF}$ minus replacement, $\sf{SF}$ is $\sf{ZF}$ minus \emph{Infinity}. Also note that universal quantifier does not appear, $\forall x \varphi (x)$ would be written as $(x) \varphi (x)$. The symbol for negation is "$\sim$", implication is written as "$\supset$" and equivalence is "$\equiv$", we will use "$\neg$", "$\then$" and "$\iff$". % TODO neco o : a setreni zavorek?

Next two definitions are not used in contemporary set theory, but they illustrate 1960's set theory mind-set and they are used heavily in Lévy's text, so we will include and explain them for clarity. Generally, in this chapter, $\sf{Q}$ stands for an arbitrary axiomatic set theory used for general definitions, $u$ is usually a model of $\sf{Q}$, counterpart of today's $V$.

This subsection uses $\sf{ZF}$ instead of the usual $\sf{ZFC}$ as the underlying theory.

% TODO je to relativizovany, jak rika shepherdson? % WATT?
\begin{definition}{(Standard model of a set theory)}\label{def:sm_q}\\
Let $\sf{Q}$ be a axiomatic set theory in first-order logic. We say the the a class $u$ is a standard model of $\sf{Q}$ with respect to a membership relation $E$, written as $Sm^{\sf{Q}}(u)$, iff both of the following hold
\bce[(i)]
\item $(x, y) \in E \iff y \in u \et x \in y$
\item $y \in u \et x \in y \then x \in u$
\ece
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Standard complete model of a set theory}\label{def:scm_q}\\
Let $\sf{Q}$ and $E$ be like in \ref{def:sm_q}. We say that that $u$ is a standard complete model of $\sf{Q}$ with respect to a membership relation $E$ iff both of the following hold
\bce[(i)]
\item $u$ is a transitive set with respect to $\in$
\item $\forall E ((x, y) \in E \iff (y \in u \et x \in y) \et Sm^{\sf{Q}}(u, E))$
\ece
this is written as $Scm^{\sf{Q}}(u)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Inaccessible cardinal with respect to $\sf{Q}$)}\label{def:levy_inaccessible_q}\\
Let $\sf{Q}$ be an axiomatic first-order set theory. We say that a cardinal $\kappa$ is inaccessible with respect to $\sf{Q}$, we write $In^{\sf{Q}}(\kappa)$.
\begin{equation}
In^{\sf{Q}}(\kappa) \defeq Scm^{\sf{Q}}(V_\kappa).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Inaccessible cardinal with respect to $\sf{ZF}$)}\label{def:levy_inaccessible}\\
When a cardinal $\kappa$ is inaccessible with respect to $\sf{ZF}$, we only say that it is inaccessible. We write $In(\kappa)$.
\begin{equation}
In(\kappa) \defeq In^{\sf{ZF}}(\kappa)
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
The above definition of inaccessibles is used because it doesn't require \emph{Choice}.

For the definition of relativization, see \ref{def:relativization}. The syntax used by Lévy is $Rel(u, \varphi)$, we will use $\varphi^{u}$, which is more usual these days.

\begin{definition}{($N$)}\label{def:levy_axiom_n}\\
The following is an axiom schema of complete reflection over $\sf{ZF}$, denoted as $N$.
\begin{equation}
N \defeq \exists u (Scm^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et \forall x_1, \ldots , x_n (x_1, \ldots , x_n \in u \then \varphi \iff \varphi^{u}))
\end{equation}
where $\varphi$ is a~formula which contains no free variables except for $x_1, \ldots , x_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{($N_0$)}\label{def:levy_axiom_n0}\\
With $\sf{S}$ instead of $\sf{ZF}$we obtain what will now be called $N_0$.
\begin{equation}
N_0 \defeq \exists u (Scm^{\sf{S}}(u) \et \forall x_1, \ldots , x_n (x_1, \ldots , x_n \in u \then \varphi \iff \varphi^{u}))
\end{equation}
where $\varphi$ is a~formula which contains no free variables except for $x_1, \ldots , x_n$.
\end{definition}

% Once we have established the definitions, it's time to prove something interesting.
% Note that this by (\ref{def:levy_inaccessible}) equivalent to $\exists u (In^{\sf{ZF}}(u) \et \forall x_1, \ldots , x_n (x_1, \ldots , x_n \in u \then \varphi \iff \varphi^{u}))$, where $In(\alpha)$ is equivalent to the standard notion of inaccessibility.
\subsection{$\sf{S} \models (N_0\ \iff\ \emph{Replacement} \et \emph{Infinity})$} 
% nebyl by to lepsi nadpis bez S?

Let $\sf{S}$ be a set theory defined in \ref{def:s}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:scm_s_is_limit}\
The following holds for every $u$.
\begin{equation}
\mbox{"$u$ is a limit ordinal"} \iff Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
TODO !

----

In order to prove that it is a~model of $\sf{S}$, we would need to verify all axioms of $\sf{S}$. We have already shown that $\omega$ is closed under the powerset operation. Foundation, extensionality and comprehension are clear from the fact that we work in $\sf{ZF}$\footnote{We only need to verify axioms that provide means of constructing larger sets from smaller to make sure they don't exceed $\omega$. Since $\omega$ is an initial segment of $ZF$, the axiom scheme of specification can't be broken, the same holds for foundation and extensionality.}, pairing is clear from the fact, that given two sets $x$, $y$, they have ranks $\alpha$, $\beta$, without loss of generality we can assume that $\alpha \leq \beta$, which means that $x \in V_\alpha \in V_\beta$, therefore $V_\beta$ is a~set that satisfies the paring axiom: it contains both $x$ and $B$.

\end{proof}

Let $N_0$ be defined as in \ref{def:levy_axiom_n0}, for \emph{Infinity} see \ref{def:infinity}.
\begin{theorem}\
In $\sf{S}$, the schema $N_0$ implies \emph{Infinity}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Lévy skips this proof because it seems too obvious to him, but let's do it here for plasticity.
For an arbitrary $\varphi$, $N_0$ gives us $\exists u Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$, but from lemma \ref{lemma:scm_s_is_limit}, we know that this $u$ is a limit ordinal. This $u$ already satisfies \emph{Infinity}.
\end{proof}

\

Let $N_0$ be defined as in \ref{def:levy_axiom_n0}, for \emph{Replacement} see \ref{def:replacement}, $\sf{S}$ is again the set theory defined in $\ref{def:s}$.
\begin{theorem}
In $\sf{S}$, the schema $N_0$ implies \emph{Replacement}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ be a~formula with no free variables except $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n$ for an arbitrary natural number $n$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\chi = \forall x, y, z(\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et \varphi(x, z, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \then y = z) \\
\then \forall x \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff \exists q (q \in x \et \varphi(q, z, p_1, \ldots, p_n)))
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
Let $\chi$ be an instance of \emph{Replacement} schema for given $\varphi$. Let the following formulas be instances of the $N_0$ schema for formulas  $\varphi$, $\exists y \varphi$, $\chi$ and $\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \chi$ respectively:

% TODO pozor nazmatek ve jmenech promennych
We can deduce the following from $N_0$: 
\bce[(i)]
\item $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then (\varphi \iff \varphi^{u}) $
\item $x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then (\exists y \varphi \iff (\exists y \varphi)^{u})$
\item $x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then (\chi \iff \chi^{u})$
\item $\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n (\chi \iff (\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \chi)^{u})$
\ece

From relativization, we also know that $(\exists y \varphi)^{u}$ is equivalent to $(\exists y \in u) \varphi^{u})$.
Therefore $\bold{(ii)}$ is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then (\exists y \in u) \varphi^{u})). 
\end{equation}

If $\varphi$ is a~function\footnote{See definition \ref{def:function}}, then for every $x \in u$, which is also $x \subset u$ by the transitivity of $Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$,
it maps elements of $x$ onto $u$. From the axiom scheme of comprehension\footnote{Lévy uses its equivalent, axiom of subsets}, we can find $y$, a~set of all images of elements of $x$.
That gives us $x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then \chi$. By $\bold{(iii)}$ we get $x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then \chi^{u}$, the universal closure of this formula is $(\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \chi)^{u}$, 
which together with $\bold{(iv)}$ yields $\forall x, p_1, \ldots, p_n \chi$. Via universal instantiation, we end up with $\chi$. We have inferred replacement for a given arbitrary formula. 
\end{proof}

What we have just proven is just a single theorem from the above mentioned article by Lévy, we will introduce other interesting propositions, mostly related to the existence of large cardinals, later in their appropriate context in chapter 3.

% \newpage
\subsection{Contemporary restatement}
We will now prove what is also Lévy's first-order reflection theorem, but rephrased with up to date set theory terminology. The main difference is, that while Lévy reflects $\varphi$ from $V$ to a set $u$ that is a "standard complete model of $\sf{S}$", we say that there is a $V_\alpha$ for a limit $\alpha$ that reflects $\varphi$. We will argue that those are equivalent.\footnote{TODO nekde na to bude lemma!}

We will now prove the equivalence of $N_0$\footnote{For the definition, confront \ref{def:n_0}} with \emph{Replacement} and \emph{Infinity} in $\sf{S}$ in two parts. First, we will show that $N_0$ is a theorem of $\sf{ZFC}$, then we shall show that the second implication, which proves \emph{Infinity} and \emph{Replacement} from $N_0$, also holds.

The following lemma is usually done in more parts, the first being for one formula, the other for $n$ formulas. We will only state and prove the more general version for $n$ formulas, knowing that setting $n=1$ turns it to a specific version.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:reflection_lemma}\
Let $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ be formulas with $m$ parameters\footnote{For formulas with a different number of parameters, take for $m$ the highest number of parameters among those formulas. Add spare parameters to every formula that has less than $m$ parameters in a way that preserves the last parameter, which we will denote $x$. E.g. let $\varphi'_i$ be the a~formula with $k$ parameters, $k < m$. Let us set $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x) \defeq \varphi'_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{k-1}, x)$, notice that the parameters $p_k, \ldots, p_{m-1}$ are not used.}.
\bce[(i)]
\item For each set $M_0$ there is such set $M$ that $M_0 \subset M$ and the following holds for every $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$:
\begin{equation}\label{equation:refl_lemma_i}
\exists x \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x) \then (\exists x \in M) \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M$.

\item Furthermore there is an ordinal $\alpha$ such that $M_0 \subset V_\alpha$ and the following holds for each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$:
\begin{equation}\label{equation:refl_lemma_ii}
\exists x \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x) \then (\exists x \in V_\alpha) \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M$.

\item Assuming \emph{Choice}, there is $M$, $M_0 \subset M$ such that \ref{equation:refl_lemma_i} holds for every $M,\ i \leq n$ and $|M| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$.
\ece
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will simultaneously prove statements $\bold{(i)}$ and $\bold{(ii)}$, denoting $M^T$ the transitive set required by part $\bold{(ii)}$. Unless explicitly stated otherwise for specific steps, it is thought to be equivalent to $M$.

Let us first define operation $H(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1})$ that gives us the set of $x$'s with minimal rank\footnote{Rank is defined in \ref{def:rank}} satisfying $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for given parameters $p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}$ for every $i$ such that $1 \leq i \leq n$.

\begin{equation}
H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_n) = \{x \in C_i: (\forall z \in C)(rank(x) \leq rank(z))\}
\end{equation}
for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, where
\begin{equation}
C_i = \{x: \varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)\} \mbox{ for $1 \leq i \leq n$}
\end{equation}

\

Next, let's construct $M$ from given $M_0$ by induction. 
\begin{equation}
M_{i+1} = M_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^{n} \bigcup \{H_j(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}): p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M_i\}
\end{equation}
In other words, in each step we add the elements satisfying $\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for all parameters that were either available earlier or were added in the previous step. 
For statement $\bold{(ii)}$, this is the only part that differs from $\bold{(i)}$. Let us take for each step transitive closure of $M_{i+1}$ from $\bold{(i)}$. In other words, let $\gamma$ be the smallest ordinal such that 
\begin{equation}
(M^T_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^{n} \{\bigcup\{H_j(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}): p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M_i\}\}) \subset V_\gamma
\end{equation}
Then the incremetal step is like so:
\begin{equation}
M^T_{i+1} = V_\gamma
\end{equation}
The final $M$ is obtained by joining all the individual steps. 
\begin{equation}
M = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} M_i, \mbox{  }M^T = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} M^T_i = V_\alpha \mbox{ \footnote{TODO proc vime, ze existuje $\alpha$, ze to plati?}}
\end{equation}

\

We have yet to finish part $\bold{(iii)}$.
Let's try to construct a~set $M'$ that satisfies the same conditions like $M$ but is kept as small as possible. Assuming the Axiom of Choice, we can modify the process so that the cardinality of $M'$ is at most $|M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$. Note that the size of $M'$ is determined by the size of $M_0$ and, most importantly, by the size of $H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1})$ for any $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ in individual levels of the construction. Since the lemma only states existence of some $x$ that satisfies $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for any $1 \leq i \leq n$, we only need to add one $x$ for every set of parameters but $H_i(u_1, \dots, u_{m-1})$ can be arbitrarily large. Since Axiom of Choice ensures that there is a~choice function, let $F$ be a~choice function on $\power{M'}$. Also let $h_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}) = F(H_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}))$ for $i$, where $1 \leq i \leq n$, which means that $h$ is a~function that outputs an $x$ that satisfies $\varphi_i(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}, x)$ for $i$ such that $1 \leq i \leq n$ and has minimal rank among all such witnesses. The induction step needs to be redefined to
\begin{equation}
M'_{i+1} = M'_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^n \{ H_j(p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1}): p_1, \ldots, p_{m-1} \in M'_i \}
\end{equation}
This way, the amount of elements added to $M'_{i+1}$ in each step of the construction is the same as the amount of sets of parameters that yielded elements not included in $M'_i$. It is easy to see that if $M_0$ is finite, $M'$ is countable because it was constructed as a countable union of finite sets. If $M_0$ is countable or larger, the cardinality of $M'$ is equal to the cardinality of $M_0$.\footnote{It can not be smaller because $|M'_{i+1}|  \geq |M'_i|$ for every $i$. It may not be significantly larger because the maximum of elements added is the number of $n$-tuples in $M'_i$, which is of the same cardinality is $M'_i$.}
Therefore $|M'| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}{(Lévy's first-order reflection theorem)}\label{theorem:first_order_reflection}\\
Let $\varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ be a~first-order formula.
\bce[(i)]
\item For every set $M_0$ there exists $M$ such that $M_0 \subset M$ and the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)\label{equation:levy_theorem_i}
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$.

\item For every set $M_0$  there is a~transitive set $M$, $M_0 \subset M$ such that the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$.

\item For every set $M_0$ there is $\alpha$ such that $M_0 \subset V_{\alpha}$ and the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^{V_{\alpha}}(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$.

\item Assuming \emph{Choice}, for every set $M_0$ there is $M$ such that $M_0 \subset M$ and $|M| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$ and the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(p_1, \ldots, p_n)
\end{equation}
for every $p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$.
\ece
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Before we start, note that the following holds for any set $M$ if $\varphi$ is an atomic formula, as a direct consequence of relativisation to $M, \in$\footnote{See \ref{def:relativisation}. Also note that this works for relativization to $M, \in$, not $M, E$ where $E$ is an arbitrary membership relation on $M$.}. 
\begin{equation}
\varphi \iff \varphi^M
\end{equation}

Let's now prove $\bold{(i)}$ for given $\varphi$ via induction by complexity. We can safely assume that $\varphi$ contains no quantifiers besides "$\exists$" and no logical connectives other than "$\neg$" and "$\et$".
Let $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ be all subformulas of $\varphi$. Then there is a set $M$, obtained by the means of lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, for all of the formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$. 

We know that $\psi \iff \psi^M$ for atomic $\psi$, we need to verify that it won't fail in the inductive step.
Let us consider $\psi = \neg \psi'$ along with the definition of relativization for those formulas in \ref{def:relativization}.
\begin{equation}
(\neg \psi')^M \iff \neg (\psi'^M)
\end{equation}
Because the induction hypothesis says that \ref{equation:levy_theorem_i} holds for every subformula of $\psi$, we can assume that $\psi'^M \iff \psi'$, therefore the following holds:
\begin{equation}
 (\neg \psi')^{M} \iff \neg (\psi'^M) \iff \neg \psi'
\end{equation}

The same holds for $\psi = \psi_1 \et \psi_2$. From the induction hypothesis, we know that $\psi_1^M \iff \psi_1$ and $\psi_2^M \iff \psi_2$, which together with relativization for formulas in the form of $\psi_1 \et \psi_2$ gives us
\begin{equation}
(\psi_1 \et \psi_2)^M \iff \psi_1^M \et \psi_2^M \iff \psi_1 \et \psi_2
\end{equation}

\

Let's now examine the case when from the induction hypethesis, $M$ reflects $\psi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)$ and we are interested in $\psi = \exists x \psi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)$.
The induction hypothesis tells us that 
\begin{equation}
\varphi'^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \iff \psi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)
\end{equation}
so, together with above lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\psi(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff \exists x \psi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \in M) \psi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \in M) \psi'^M (p_1, \ldots, p_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \psi'(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x))^M \\
\iff \psi^M(p_1, \ldots, p_n, x)
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
Which is what we have needed to prove. \ref{equation:levy_theorem_i} holds for all subformulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ of a given formula $\varphi$.

\

So far we have proven part $\bold{(i)}$ of this theorem for one formula $\varphi$, we only need to verify that the same holds for any finite number of formulas. This has in fact been already done since lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma} gives us $M$ for any (finite) amount of formulas, we can find a set $M$ for the union of all of their subformulas. We can than use the induction above  to verify that $M$ reflects each of the formulas individually iff it reflects all of its subformulas.

\

Since $V_\alpha$ is a~transitive set, by proving $\bold{(iii)}$ we also satisfy $\bold{(ii)}$. To do so, we only need to look at part $\bold{(ii)}$ of lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}. All of the above proof also holds for $M = V_\alpha$. 

To finish part $\bold{(iv)}$, we take $M$ of size $\leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$, which exists due to part $\bold{(iii)}$ of lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, the rest being identical.
\end{proof}

Let $\sf{S}$ be a set theory defined in \ref{def:s}, for $\sf{ZFC}$ see \ref{def:zfc}.

Let $M$ be a set. Then the following holds: % TODO musi to byt v ZFC? % TODO maybe we dont need shit stuff but it's interestng

\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For the left-to-right direction, we shall verify that if $M$ is a model of $\sf{S}$, it necessarily is a limit cardinal.
From \emph{Powerset}\footnote{\ref{def:powerset}.}, we know that for any $x \in M$, $\power{x} \in M$. But that is already the definition of a strong limit cardinal\footnote{see \ref{def:strong_limit_cardinal}}.

For the converse, we need to see that if there is a limit ordinal $\alpha$, such that $V_\alpha = M$, the axioms of $\sf{S}$ hold $M$.
\bce[(i)]
\item \emph{Existence of a set} (see \ref{def:existence_of_a_set})\\
There obviously is a set $x \in M$
\item \emph{Extensionality} (see \ref{def:extensionality})\\
Since $Extensionality^M$ is a $\Delta_0$ formula, it holds in any transitive class by \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute}.\item \emph{Specification} (see \ref{def:specification})\\
TODO
\item \emph{Foundation} (see \ref{def:foundation})\\
$Foundation^M$ is also a $\Delta_0$ formula, so it holds by \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute} since $M$ is transitive because it is a cardinal.\item \emph{Pairing} (see \ref{def:pairing})\\

From $N_0$ (\ref{def:n_0}), we know that for any first-order formula $\varphi$ and a set $M_0$, there is a $M$ such that $M_0 \subseteq M$ and $\varphi^M \iff \varphi$. Let's pick \emph{Powerset} for $\varphi$, then by $N_0$ there is a set that satisfies \emph{Powerset}, ergo there is a strong limit cardinal, which in turn satisfies \emph{Infinity}.

Given a~formula $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$, we can suppose that it is reflected in any $M$ \footnote{Which means that for $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$, $\varphi^M(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \iff \varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$.}
What we want to obtain is the following:
\begin{equation}
\forall x, y, z (\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et \varphi(x, z, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \then y = z) \then
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\then \forall X \exists Y \forall y\ (y \in Y \iff \exists x (\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et x \in X ))
\end{equation}

We do also know that $x, y \in M$, in other words for every $X$, $Y\ =\ \{y\ |\ \varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}$ we know that $X \subset M$ and $Y \subset M$, which, together with the comprehension schema\footnote{Called the axiom of subsets in Lévy's proof.} implies that $Y$, the image of $X$ over $\varphi$, is a~set.
Which is exactly the \emph{Replacement} Schema we hoped to obtain.
\end{proof}

\

We have shown that $\emph{Reflection}$ for first-order formulas, $\emph{Reflection}_1$ is a~theorem of $\sf{ZF}$, which means that it won't yield us any large cardinals. We have also shown that it can be used instead of the \emph{Infinity} and \emph{Replacement} scheme, but $\sf{ZF}\ +\ \emph{Reflection}_1$ is a~conservative extension of $\sf{ZF}$. Besides being a~starting point for more general and powerful statements, it can be used to show that $\sf{ZF}$ is not finitely axiomatizable. That is because $\emph{Reflection}$ gives a~model to any finite number of (consistent) formulas. So if $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ for any finite $n$ would be the axioms of $\sf{ZF}$, $\emph{Reflection}$ would always contain a~model of itself, which would in turn contradict the Second Gödel's Theorem\footnote{See chapter \ref{section:inaccessibility} for further details.}.
Notice that, in a~way, reflection is complementary to compactness. Compactness argues that given a set of sentences, if every finite subset yields a~model, so does the whole set. Reflection, on the other hand, says that while the whole set has no model in the underlying theory, every finite subset does have one.

Also, notice how reflection can be used in ways similar to upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem. Since Reflection extends any set $M_0$ into a~model of given formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$, we can choose the lower bound of the size of $M$ by appropriately chocing $M_0$.

In the next section, we will try to generalize \emph{Reflection} in a~way that transcends $\sf{ZF}$ and finally yields some large cardinals.

\section{Reflection And Large Cardinals}

In this chapter we aim to examine stronger reflection properties in order to reach cardinals unavailable in $\sf{ZFC}$. Like we said in the first chapter, % [TODO odkaz na uvod]
the variety of reflection principles comes from the fact that there are many way to formalize "properties of the universal class". It is not always obvious what properties hold for $V$ because, 
%unlike Lévy's approach, not much attention is paid to what exactly is this $V$, and, more importantly, there are many ways to formalize the notion of property. 
We have shown that reflecting properties as first-order formulas doesn't allow us to leave $\sf{ZFC}$. We will broaden the class of admissible properties to be reflected and see whether there is a~natural limit in the height or width on the reflected universe and also see that no matter how far we go, the universal class is still as elusive as it is when seen from $\sf{S}$. That is because for every process for obtaining larger sets such as for example the powerset operation in $\sf{ZFC}$, this process can't reach $V$ and thus, from reflection, there is an initial segment of $V$ that can't be reached via said process. 

To see why this is important, let's dedicate a few lines to the intuition behind the notions of limitness, regularity and inaccessibility in a manner strongly influenced by \cite{Infinity_in_mind}. To see why limit and strongly limit cardinals are worth mentioning, note that they are "limit" not only in a sense of being a supremum of an ordinal sequence, they also show that a certain way of obtaining bigger objects from smaller ones limited in terms of possibilities. $\aleph_\lambda$ is a limit cardinal iff there is no $\alpha$ such that $\aleph_{\alpha+1}=\aleph_\lambda$. Strongly limit cardinals point to the limits of the powerset operation. It has been too obvious so far, so let's look at the regular cardinals in this manner. Regular cardinals are those that cannot be\footnote{Assuming $\emph{Choice}$.}, expressed as a supremum of smaller amount of smaller objects\footnote{Just like $\omega$ can not be expressed as a supremum of a finite set consisting solely of finite numbers.}. More precisely, $\kappa$ is regular if there is no way to define it as u union of less than $\kappa$ ordinals, all smaller than $\kappa$. So unless there already is a set of size $\kappa$, \emph{Replacement} is useless in determining whether $\kappa$ is really a set. Note that assuming \emph{Choice}, successor cardinals are always regular, so most\footnote{All provable to exist in $\sf{ZFC}$} limit cardinals are singular cardinals. So if one is traversing the class of all cardinals upwards, successor steps are still sets thanks to the powerset axiom while singular limits cardinal are not proper classes because they are images of smaller sets via \emph{Replacement}. Regular cardinals are, in a way, limits of how far can we get by taking limits of increasing sequences of ordinals obtained via $\emph{Replacement}$.

That all being said, it is easy to see that no cardinals in $\sf{ZFC}$ are both strongly limit and regular because there is no way to ensure they are sets and not proper classes in $\sf{ZFC}$. The only exception to this rule is $\aleph_0$ which needs \emph{Infinity} to exist. % nase otazka je: proc omega a ne jine kardinaly?
It should now be obvious why the fact that $\kappa$ is inaccessible implies that $\kappa\ =\ \aleph_\kappa$.\footnote{This doesn't work backwards, the least fixed point of the $\aleph$ function is the limit of $\{\aleph_0,\ \aleph_{\aleph_0},\ \aleph_{\aleph_{\aleph_0}},\ \ldots \}$, it is singular since the sequence has countably many elements.}

We will also examine the connection between reflection principles and (regular) fixed points of ordinal functions in a manner proposed by Lévy in \cite{Levy60a}. We will also see that, like Lévy has proposed in the same paper, there is a meaningful way to extend the relation between $\sf{S}$ and $\sf{ZFC}$ into a hierarchy of stronger axiomatic set theories.

\subsection{Regular Fixed-Point Axioms}
% This small chapter is dedicated to 

Lévy's article mentions various schemata that are not instances of reflection themselves. We will mention them because they are equivalent to $N_0$ and because they are fixed-point theorems, which we will find useful later in this thesis.

\begin{definition}{(Function)}
We say that a first-order formula $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ with no free variable besides $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n$ is a function iff
\begin{equation}
\forall x, y, z (\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et \varphi(x, z, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \then y=z)
\end{equation}
We will also write functions in the form of "$f(x) = y$". This is defined for given $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ and given terms $t_1, \ldots, t_n$ as follows
\begin{equation}
f(x)=y \iff \varphi(x, y, t_1, \ldots, t_n)
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

$Ord$ denotes the class of all ordinal numbers.
\begin{definition}{(Strictly increasing function)}\label{def:increasing_function}\\
A function $f: Ord \then Ord$ is said to be \emph{strictly increasing} iff
\begin{equation}
\forall \alpha, \beta \in Ord (\alpha < \beta \then f(\alpha) < f(\beta)).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Continuous function)}\label{def:continuous_function}\\
A function $f: Ord \then Ord$ is said to be \emph{continuous} iff
\begin{equation}
\alpha\mbox{ is limit} \then (f(\alpha) = lim_{\beta < \alpha} f(\beta)).
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
Alternatively, a function $f: Ord \then Ord$ is continuous iff for limit $\lambda$, $f(\lambda) = \bigcup_{\alpha < \lambda} f(\alpha)$.
% nebo taky $f(\lambda) = sup {f(\alpha) : \alpha < \lambda}$.

\begin{definition}{(Normal function)}\label{def:normal_function}\\
A function $f: Ord \then Ord$ is said to be \emph{normal} if it is \emph{strictly increasing} and \emph{continuous}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Normal function on a set)} Let $\alpha, \delta$ be ordinals. A function $f: \delta \then \alpha$ is called a \emph{normal function on $\alpha$} iff all of the following hold:
\bce[(i)]
\item $f$ is strictly increasing on $\alpha$\footnote{$x \mbox{ is limit} \then (f(x)) = \bigcup_{y < x} f(y)$}
\item $f$ is continuous on $\alpha$
\item the $rng(f)\ =\ \{y: \exists x(f(x)\ =\ y)\}$ is unbounded in $\alpha$.
 \ece
\end{definition} % TODO potrebujeme ji vubec? nema byt (rostouci na alfa), (spojita na alda), ...?

\begin{definition}{Fixed point}\\
We say $\alpha$ is a fixed point of ordinal function $f$ when $\alpha=f(\alpha)$.
\end{definition}

Lévy (\cite{Levy60a}) proposes those axioms as equivalent to one on his reflection principles.
\begin{definition}
$M \iff$ "Every normal function defined for all ordinals has at least one inaccessible number in its range."
\end{definition}
We will rewrite $M$ as a formula to make it clear that it is an axiom scheme and the same can be done with $M'$ as well as $M''$.

Let $\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ be a first-order formula with no free variables besides $x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n$. The following is equivalent to $M$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\varphi\mbox{ is a normal function} \et \forall x (x \in Ord \then \exists y(\varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n))) \then
\then \exists y (\exists x \varphi(x, y, p_1, \ldots, p_n) \et cf(y) = y \et Lim(\kappa))
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}
$M' \iff $ "Every normal function defined for all ordinals has at least one fixed point which is inaccessible."
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
$M'' \iff $ "Every normal function defined for all ordinals has arbitrarily great fixed points which are inaccessible."
\end{definition}


The following axiom is proposed by Drake in \cite{DrakeBook}. 
\begin{definition}{$F$}
Every normal function for all ordinals has a regular fixed point.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\begin{equation}
F \iff M \iff M' \iff M''
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
One can find the proof of $M \iff M' \iff M''$ in \cite{Levy60a}, \emph{Theorem 1}. %, we will only prove that Drake's $F$ is equivalent too.

TODO podle Levyho

%Since $M'$ makes sure that for arbitrary $f :\ On \then On$ there is an ordinal $\alpha$ such that $In(\alpha) \et f(\alpha) = \alpha$ that already satisfies $F$.

%For the opposite direction, suppose we have an ordinal function $f$ that has a regular fixed point. We want to prove that $f$ has an inaccessible fixed point. Let's construct a function $f'$ on all ordinals that enumerates the strongly limit ordinals in the range of $f$. $F$ implies that $f'$ also has a regular fixed point, which is therefore an inaccessible ordinal. Let $\alpha$ be the least such ordinal. We have yet to prove that $\alpha$ is also a fixed point of $f$. There is some $\beta$ such that $f(\beta) = \alpha = f'(\alpha)$. Because $f$ is normal, $\beta \leq f(\beta)$\footnote{This can be easily proven: suppose it's not the case and there's the least $\gamma$ such that $f(\gamma) < \gamma$. Because $f$ is increasing, $f(f(\gamma)) < f(\gamma)$, which contradicts the fact that $\gamma$ was supposed to be the least such ordinal.}, so $\beta \leq \alpha$. Since $\alpha$ is regular

%Now let's take the function $f: \alpha \then \aleph_\alpha$, it also has a regular fixed point as implied by $F$. Since for successor ordinals it holds that $\alpha < \aleph_\alpha$, all fixed points are limit ordinals and therefore there is an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$. For any normal $f$ defined on all ordinals, $f(\kappa)$ is also an inaccessible cardinal.\footnote{Proc?}. We have proven $F \then M$.

% WIKI: Any weakly inaccessible cardinal is also a fixed point of the aleph function.[6] This can be shown in ZFC as follows. Suppose \kappa = \aleph_\lambda is a weakly inaccessible cardinal. If \lambda were a successor ordinal, then \aleph_\lambda would be a successor cardinal and hence not weakly inaccessible. If \lambda were a limit ordinal less than  \kappa , then its cofinality (and thus the cofinality of \aleph_\lambda) would be less than \kappa  and so \kappa  would not be regular and thus not weakly inaccessible. Thus \lambda \geq \kappa  and consequently \lambda = \kappa  which makes it a fixed point.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Reflecting Second-order Formulas}

% TODO proc? sem patri ta "kontradikce"!

To see that there is a~way to transcend $\sf{ZFC}$, let us briefly show how a~model of $\sf{ZFC}$ can be obtained in $\sf{ZFC}_2 + \mbox{"second-order reflection"}$\footnote{$\sf{ZFC}_2$ is an axiomatization of $\sf{ZFC}$ in second-order formulas, to be more rigorously established later.}. This will be more closely examined in section \ref{section:inaccessibility}.

We know that $\sf{ZFC}$ can not be finitely axiomatized in first-order formulas, however if \emph{Replacement} and \emph{Comprehension} schemes can be substituted by second-order formulas, $\sf{ZFC}$ becomes $\sf{ZFC}_2$, which is finitely axiomatizable in second-order logic. Therefore if we take second-order reflection into consideration, we can obtain a~set $M$ that is a~model of $\sf{ZFC}_2$. For now, we have left out the details of how exactly is first-order reflection generalised into stronger statements and how second-order axiomatization of $\sf{ZFC}$ looks like as we will examine those problems closely in the following pages. 

% We also need to rigorously define $\sf{ZFC}_2$, the second-order axiomatization of $\sf{ZFC}$ we have already used in the previous section. Let's take advantage of second-order variables and replace \emph{Replacement} and Specification schemes with a~single \emph{Replacement} and a Specification axiom respectively. 

Lower-case letters represent first-order variables and upper-case $P$ represents a~second-order variable. \cite{Shapiro87}
\begin{definition}{(\emph{Replacement}\textsubscript{2})}\label{def:replacement_2}\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\forall P (\forall x, y, z (P(x, y) \et P(x, z) \then y\ =\ z) \then \\
\then (\forall x \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff \exists w \in x (P(w, z)))))
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
We will denote this axiom \emph{Replacement}\textsubscript{2}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(\emph{Specification}\textsubscript{2})}\\
\begin{equation}
\forall P \forall x \exists y \forall z \, ( z \in y \iff ( z \in x \et P(z, x)))
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(\sf{ZFC}\textsubscript{2})}\\
Let $\sf{ZFC\textsubscript{2}}$ be a~theory with all axioms identical with the axioms of $\sf{ZFC}$ with the exception of \emph{Replacement} and \emph{Specification} schemes, which are replaced with \emph{Replacement}\textsubscript{2} and \emph{Specification}\textsubscript{2} respectively.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Inaccessibility}\label{section:inaccessibility}
%The inaccessible cardinal is the smallest of large cardinals\footnote{citation needed.}
\begin{definition}{(limit cardinal)}\label{def:limit}
$\kappa$ is a~\emph{limit cardinal} iff it is $\aleph_\alpha$ for some limit ordinal $\alpha$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(strong limit cardinal)}\label{def:strong_limit}
$\kappa$ is a~\emph{strong limit cardinal} iff it is a limit cardinal and for every $\lambda < \kappa$, $2^\lambda < \kappa$
\end{definition}

The two above definition become equivalent when we assume $GCH$.

\begin{definition}{(weak inaccessibility)}\label{def:weakly_inaccessible}
An uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ is \emph{weakly inaccessible} iff it is \emph{regular} and \emph{limit}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}(inaccessibility)\label{def:inaccessible}
An uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ is \emph{inaccessible} (written $In(\alpha)$) iff it is \emph{regular} and \emph{strongly limit}.
\end{definition}

\

We will now show that the above notion is equivalent to the definition Lévy uses in \cite{Levy60a}, which is, in more contemporary notation, the following:
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc}
The following are equivalent:
\bce
\item $\kappa$ in inaccessible
\item $\langle V_\kappa, \in \rangle \models \sf{ZFC}$
\ece
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let's first prove that if $\kappa$ is inaccessible, it is a~model of $\sf{ZFC}$. We will do that by verifying the axioms of $\sf{ZFC}$ just like Kanamori does it in in \cite[1.2]{KanamoriBook} and Drake in \cite[Chapter 4]{DrakeBook}. 
\bce[(i)]
\item \emph{Extensionality}:\\
(see \ref{def:extensionality})
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x, y(\forall z (z \in x \iff z \in y) \then x = y) 
\end{equation}
We need to prove that, given two sets that are equal in $V$, they are equal in $V_\kappa$, in other words, that the \emph{Extensionality} formula is reflected, that is
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x, y \in V_\kappa (\forall z \in V_\kappa (z \in x \iff z \in y) \then x = y) 
\end{equation}
But that comes from transitivity. If $x$ and $y$ are in $V_\kappa$ their members are also in $V_\kappa$.

\

\item \emph{Foundation}:\\
(see \ref{def:foundation})
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x (\exists z (z \in x) \then \exists z (z \in x \et \forall u \neg (u \in z \et u \in x)))
\end{equation}
The argument for \emph{Foundation} is almost identical to the one for \emph{Extensionality}. For any set $x \in V_\kappa$, transitivity of $V_\kappa$ makes sure that every element of $x$ is also an element of $V_\kappa$ and the same holds for the elements of elements of $x$ et cetera. So statements about those elements are absolute between any transitive structures. $V$ and $V_\kappa$ are both transitive therefore \emph{Foundation} holds and so does its relativisation to $V_\kappa$, $Foundation^{V_\kappa}$.

\

\item \emph{Powerset}:\\
(see \ref{def:powerset})
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x \exists y \forall z (z \subseteq x \then z \in y).
\end{equation}
If we take $x$, an element of $V_\kappa$, $\power{x}$ has to be an element of $V_\kappa$ to, because it is transitive and a strong limit cardinal.

\

\item \emph{Pairing}:\\
(see \ref{def:pairing})
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x, y \exists z (x \in z \land y \in z).
\end{equation}
\emph{Pairing} holds from similar argument like above: let $x$ and $y$ be elements of $V_\kappa$, so there are ordinals $\alpha, \beta < \kappa$ such that $x \in V_\alpha$, $y \in V_\beta$. Without any loss of generality, suppose $\alpha < \beta$, threfore $V_\alpha \subset V_\beta$ which, from transitivity of the cumulative hierarchy, means that $x \in V_\beta$, then $\{x, y\} \in V_{\beta+1}$ which is still in $V_\kappa$ because it is a strong limit cardinal.

\

\item \emph{Union}:\\
(see \ref{def:union})
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x \,\exists y \, \forall z\, \forall w ((w \in z \land z \in x) \then w \in y).
\end{equation}
We want to see that for every $x \in V_\kappa$, this is equivalent to 
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \forall x \in V_\kappa,\exists y \in V_\kappa\, \forall z \in V_\kappa\, \forall w \in V_\kappa ((w \in z \land z \in x) \then w \in y).
\end{equation}
Since $V_\kappa$ is transitive, if $x \in V_\kappa$, all of its elements as well as their elements are in $V_\kappa$. To see that they also form a set themselves we only need to remember that $V_\kappa$ is limit and therefore if $\alpha$ is the least ordinal such that $x \in V_\alpha$, $\bigcup x \in V_{\alpha+1}$.

\

\item \emph{Replacement, Infinity}:\\
(see \ref{def:replacement}, \ref{def:infinity})\\
We know that those hold from \ref{levy_equivalence_contemporary}.
\ece
\

We will now show that if a~set is a~model of $\sf{ZFC}$, it is in fact an inaccessible cardinal. So let $V_\kappa$ be a~model of $\sf{ZFC}$ which means that it is closed under the powerset operation, in other words:
\begin{equation}
\forall \lambda (\lambda < \kappa \then 2^{\lambda} < \kappa)
\end{equation}
which is exactly the definition of strong limitness. $\kappa$ is regular from the following argument by contradiction:\\
Let us suppose for a~moment that $\kappa$ is singular. Therefore there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ and a~function $F:\ \alpha \then \kappa$ such that the range of $F$ in unbounded in $\kappa$, in other words, $F[\alpha] \subseteq V_\kappa$ and $sup(F[\alpha])\ =\ \kappa$. In order to achieve the desired contradiction, we need to see that it is the case that $F[\alpha] \in V_\kappa$. Let $\varphi(x, y)$ be the following first-order formula: % TODO vyhodit sup, pouzivat radis $\bigcup$
\begin{equation}
F(x)\ =\ y
\end{equation}
Then there is an instance of \emph{Replacement} that states the following:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
(\forall x, y, z(\varphi(x, y) \et \varphi(x, z) \then y\ =\ z)) \then \\
\then (\forall x \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff \exists w (\varphi(w, z))))
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
Which in turn means that there is a~set $y = F[\alpha]$ and $y \in V_\kappa$, which is the contradiction with $sup(y) = \kappa$ we are looking for.
\end{proof}
% TODO vyhodit sup, pouzivat radis $\bigcup$

\

The same holds for $\sf{ZFC}_2$, the proof is very similar.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc_2}
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \sf{ZFC}_2 \iff \mbox{$\kappa$ is inaccessible}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\kappa$ is a~strong limit cardinal because from $\sf{ZFC}_2$ and \emph{Powerset} we know that for every $\lambda\ <\ \kappa$, we know that $2^{\lambda} < \kappa$.

$\kappa$ is also regular, because otherwise there would be an ordinal $\alpha$ and a~function $F:\ \alpha \then \kappa$ with a~range unbounded in $\kappa$. 
$\emph{Replacement}^2$ gives us a~set $y\ =\ F[\alpha]$, so $y\ \in\ V_\kappa$, which contradicts the fact that $sup(y)\ =\ \kappa$. It can not be the case that $\kappa \in V_\kappa$.
% TODO vyhodit sup, pouzivat radis $\bigcup$
\

The other direction is exactly like the first part of above theorem \ref{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc}.
\end{proof}

\

This is how the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is established in \cite{Levy60a}. 
\begin{definition}{$N$}\\
\begin{equation}
\exists u (In(\alpha) \et \forall p_1, \ldots, p_n (p_1, \ldots, p_n \in u \then (\varphi \iff \varphi^u)))
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
It is interesting to see that the above schema yields the first inaccessible cardinal if we take for $\varphi$ the conjunction of all axioms of $\sf{ZF_2}$.

\

To see that inaccessible cardinal can be also obtained by a fixed-point axiom (or a scheme if were in first-order logic), see the following theorem by Lévy, we won't repeat the proof here, it is available in \cite[Theorem 3]{Levy60a}, 
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:levy_m_iff_n}
\begin{equation}
M \iff N
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

%The above makes clear that while the existence of inaccessibles is unprovable in $\sf{ZFC}$ or $\sf{ZFC}_2$, we now know that at least the smallest inaccessible cardinal exists in $\sf{ZF+(Refl^2)}$ because there is a~set that models $\sf{ZFC}$. But how exactly can we reach there with second-order reflection?

% TODO

We have transcended $\sf{ZFC}$, but that is just a~start. Naturally, we could go on and consider the next inaccessible cardinal, which is inaccessible with respect to the theory $\sf{ZFC} + \exists \kappa (\kappa \models \sf{ZFC})$. But let's try to find a faster way up, informally at first. 

Since we can find an inaccessible set larger than any chosen set $M_0$, it is clear that there are arbitrarily large inaccessible cardinals in $V$, they are "unbounded"\footnote{The notion is formaly defined for sets, but the meaning should be obvious.} in $V$. If $V$ were a cardinal, we could say that there are $V$ inaccesible cardinals less than $V$, but this statement of course makes no sense in set theory as is because $V$ is not a set. But being more careful, we could find a property that can be formalized in second-order logic and reflect it to an initial segment of $V$. That would allow us to construct large cardinals more efficiently than by adding inaccessibles one by one. The property we are looking for ought to look like something like this:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\kappa \mbox{ is an inaccessible cardinal and}\\
\mbox{there are }\kappa\mbox{ inaccessible cardinals }\mu\ <\ \kappa
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
This is in fact a fixed-point type of statement. We shall call those cardinals hyper-inaccessible. Now consider the following definition.

\

\begin{definition}{$0$-inaccessible cardinal}\\
A cardinal $\kappa$ is $0$-inaccessible if it is inaccessible.
\end{definition}
We can define \emph{$\alpha$-weakly-inaccessible} cardinals analogously with the only difference that those are limit, not strongly limit.
\

\begin{definition}{$\alpha$-hyper-inaccessible cardinal}\label{def:alpha_inaccessible}\\
For any ordinal $\alpha$, $\kappa$ is called $\alpha$-inaccessible, if $\kappa$ is inaccessible and for each $\beta$ < $\alpha$, the set of $\beta$-inaccessible cardinals less than $\kappa$ is unbounded in $\kappa$.
\end{definition}

\

Because $\kappa$ is inaccessible and therefore regular, the number of $\beta$-inaccessibles below $\kappa$ is equal to $\kappa$. We have therefore successfully formalized the above vague notion of hyper-inaccessible cardinal into a hierarchy of $\alpha$-inaccessibles.

\

Let's now consider iterating this process over again. Since, informally, $V$ would be $\alpha$-inaccessible for any $\alpha$, this property of the universal class could possibly be reflected to an initial segment, the smallest of those will be the first hyper-inaccessible cardinal. Such $\kappa$ is larger than any $\alpha$-inaccessible since from regularity of $\kappa$, for given $\alpha\ <\ \kappa$, $\kappa$ is $\kappa$-th $\alpha$-hyper-inaccessible cardinal. It is in fact "inaccessible" via $\alpha$-inaccessibility.

\

\begin{definition}{Hyper-inaccessible cardinal}\\
$\kappa$ is called the hyper-inaccessible, also $0$-hyper-inaccessible, cardinal if it is $\alpha$-inaccessible for every $\alpha\ <\ \kappa$.
\end{definition}

\

\begin{definition}{$\alpha$-hyper-inaccessible cardinal}\\
For any ordinal $\alpha$, $\kappa$ is called $\alpha$-hyper-inaccessible cardinal if for each ordinal $\beta\ <\ \alpha$, the set of $\beta$-hyper-inaccessible cardinals less the $\kappa$ is inbounded in $\kappa$.
\end{definition}

\

Obviously we could go on and iterate it ad libitum, but the nomenclature would be increasingly confusing. A smarter way to accomplish the same goal is carried out in the following section.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:refl_inaccessible}[Lévy] The following are equivalent:
\bce[(i)]
\item $\kappa$ is inaccessible.
\item For every $R \sub V_\kappa$ and every first-order formula $\varphi(R)$, $\varphi(R)$ reflects in $V_\kappa$.
\item For every $R \sub V_\kappa$, the set $C = \set{\alpha<\kappa}{\langle V_\alpha,\in,R \cap V_\alpha\rangle \el \langle V_\kappa,\in,R \rangle}$ is closed unbounded.
\ece
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let's start with $\bold{(i)} \then \bold{(iii)}$ in a~way similar to \cite{KanamoriBook}.\newline
The set $\set{\alpha<\kappa}{\langle V_\alpha,\in,R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \el \langle V_\kappa,\in,R\rangle}$ is clearly closed, it remains to show that it is also unbounded.
To do so, let $\alpha<\kappa$ be arbitrary. Define $\alpha_n < \kappa$ for $n\in\omega$ by recursion as follows:\newline
Set $\alpha_0=\alpha$. Given $\alpha_n < \kappa$ define $\alpha_{n+1}$ to be the least $\beta \geq \alpha_n$ such as 
whenever $y_1,\ldots,y_k \in V_{\alpha_n}$ and
$\langle V_{\kappa}, \in, R \rangle \models \exists v_0 \varphi [v_0, y_1, \ldots, y_k ]$
for some formula $\varphi$, there is an $x \in V_{\beta}$ such that $\langle V_{\kappa}, \in, R\rangle \models \varphi [x, y_1, \ldots, y_k]$.
\newline
Since $\kappa$ is inaccessible, $|V_{\alpha_n}| < \kappa$ and so $\alpha_{n+1} < \kappa$.\newline
Finally, set $\alpha = sup({\alpha_n | n \in \omega})$.  % TODO vyhodit sup, pouzivat radis $\bigcup$
Then $\langle$
 $V_ \alpha, \in, R  \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_{\kappa}, \in, R\rangle$ by the usual (Tarski) criterion for elementary substructure.
 \newline\newline
 The next part, proving $\bold{(iii)} \then \bold{(ii)}$, should be elementary since $C$ is closed unbounded, which means that it contains at least countably many elements but we need only one such $\alpha$ to satisfy (\ref{def:reflection_2}).
 \newline
 Finally, we shall prove that $(ii) \then \bold{(i)}$. Since it obviously holds that $\kappa > \omega$, we have yet to prove that $\kappa$ is regular and a~strong limit. Let's argue by contradiction that it is regular. 
 If it wasn't, there would be a~$\beta < \kappa$ and a~function $F: \beta \implies \kappa$ with range unbounded in $\kappa$. Set $R = \{\beta\} \cup F$. By hypothesis there is an $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, R \rangle$. Since $\beta$ is the single ordinal in R, $\beta \in V_\alpha$ by elementarity. This yields the desired contradiction since the domain if $F \cap V_\alpha$ cannot be all of $\beta$.
 \newline\newline
 Next, let's see whether $\kappa$ is indeed a~strong limit, again by contradiction. If not, there would be a~$\lambda < \kappa$ such that $2^\lambda \geq \kappa$. Let $G: \power{\lambda} \implies \kappa$ be surjective and set $R = \{\lambda + 1\} \cup G$. By hypothesis, there is an $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, R \rangle$. $\lambda + 1 \in V_\alpha$ and so $\power{\lambda} \in V_\alpha$, but this is again a~contradiction.

\subsection{Mahlo Cardinals}

% TODO ze je to trochu diagonalni argument

While the previous chapter introduced us to a notion of inaccessibility and the possibility of iterating it ad libitum in new theories, there is an even faster way to travel upwards in the cumulative hierarchy, that was proposed by Paul Mahlo in his papers (see \cite{Mahlo11}, \cite{Mahlo12} and \cite{Mahlo13}) at the very beginning of the 20th century, and which can be easily reformulated using $\emph(Reflection)$. To see how Lévy's initial statement of reflection was influenced by Mahlo's work, refer to section \ref{sec:Levy1960}. The aim of the following paragraphs is to give an intuitive explanation of the idea behind Mahlo's hierarchy of cardinals, all claims made here ought to be stated formally later in the very same chapter.

At the very end of section \ref{section:inaccessibility}, we have tried to establish the notion of hyper-inaccessibility and iterate it to yield even larger large cardinals. In order to avoid too bulky cardinal names, let's try a different route and establish those cardinals directly via reflection.

\

% TODO WATT
The following two definitions come from \cite{Infinity_in_mind} and while they are rather informal, we will find them very helpful for understanding the Mahlo cardinals.
\begin{definition}{(Fixed-point property)}\\
For any first-order formula $\psi(x, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ with no free variables other than $x, p_1, \ldots, p_n$, which is any property of ordinals, we say that a property $\varphi$ is a $\emph{fixed-point property}$ if $\varphi$ has the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\mbox{$x$ is an inaccessible cardinal and }\\
\mbox{there are $x$ ordinals less than $x$ that have the property $\psi(x, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$.}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\

% TODO WATT?
\begin{definition}{(Fixed-point reflection)}\\
If $\varphi$ is a fixed-point property that holds for $V$, it also holds for some $V_\alpha$, an initial segment of $V$.
\end{definition}

Obviously those are in no way rigorous definitions because we have no idea what $\psi(x, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ looks like. Let's try to restate the same idea in a useful way. But first, let's show that the formal counterpart of the idea of containing "enough" ordinals with a property is the notion of stationary set. 

\begin{definition}{(Supremum)}\\
Given $x$ a set of ordinals, the supremum of $x$, denoted sup($x$), is the least upper bound of $x$. % TODO vyhodit sup, pouzivat radis $\bigcup$
\begin{equation}
sup(x)\ =\ \bigcup x
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Limit point)}\\
Given $x$, a set of ordinals and an ordinal $\alpha$, we say that $\alpha$ is a \emph{limit point} of $x$ if $sup(x \cap \alpha)\ =\ \alpha$
\end{definition}
% funfuje to, protoze alpha je ordinal, takze kdyz je alpha nejvyssi a je to zaroven mnozina vsech mensich ordinalu, je to presne supremum. kdyz tam neni, ale A obsahuje vsechny mensi ordinaly, je to nejmensi horni zavora, tedy alpha

\begin{definition}{(Set Unbounded in $\alpha$)}
Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal. We say that $x \subset \alpha$ is \emph{unbounded in $\alpha$} iff
\begin{equation}
\forall \beta \in Ord (\beta < \alpha \then \exists \gamma (\gamma \in x (\beta \leq \gamma < \alpha)))
\end{equation} % TODO WTF?
\end{definition}

\begin{comment}

\begin{definition}{(Closed set)}
We say that set $x$ is closed if it contains all of its limit points.\\
\\
Alternatively, subset $x$ of $\alpha$ is closed in $\alpha$ iff for every limit ordinal $\beta < \alpha$, if $C \cap \beta$
is unbounded in $\beta$ then $\beta \in C$.
% TODO WATT
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Club set)}\\
For a regular uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, a set $x\ \subset\ \kappa$ is a \emph{closed unbounded} subset, abbreviated as a \emph{club set}, iff $x$ is both closed and unbounded in $\kappa$.
% which means that for every $\beta$ < $\kappa$ there is a $\beta'\ \in \alpha$ such that $\beta\ <\ \beta'\ <\ \kappa$.
\end{definition}
% TODO mozna kratka uvaha proc to musi byt regularni?

\begin{definition}{(Stationary set)}\\
For a regular uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, a set $A\ \subset\ \kappa$ is stationary iff it intersects every club subset of $\kappa$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}{}\label{club_intersection} 
The intersection of fewer than $\kappa$\footnote{$\kappa$ is again a regular uncountable cardinal and it will always be when we will be talking about club sets.} club subsets of $\kappa$ is a club set.
\end{theorem}
For proof, see \cite[Theorem 8.3]{JechBook}

\begin{definition}{Weakly Mahlo Cardinal}\label{def:weakly_mahlo}\\
$\kappa$ is \emph{weakly Mahlo} $\iff$ it is a~regular limit ordinal and the set of all regular ordinals less then $\kappa$ is stationary in $\kappa$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Mahlo Cardinal}\label{def:mahlo_cardinal}\\
$\kappa$ is a \emph{Mahlo Cardinal} iff it is an inaccessible cardinal and the set of all inaccessible ordinals less then $\kappa$ is stationary in $\kappa$.
\end{definition}
It is interesting to note, that weakly-Mahlo cardinals are fixed points of $\alpha$-weakly inaccessible cardinals, so if $\kappa$ is weakly mahlo,  .. viz Kanamori Proposition 1.1

Analogously, 
\begin{definition}{$\alpha$-Mahlo Cardinal}\label{def:alpha_mahlo_cardinal}\\
$\kappa$ is a \emph{$\alpha$-Mahlo Cardinal} iff it is an $\alpha$-inaccessible cardinal and the set of all $\alpha$-inaccessible ordinals less then $\kappa$ is stationary in $\kappa$.
\end{definition}

\end{comment}

\

In other words, $\kappa$ is a mahlo cardinal if it is inaccessible and every club set in $\kappa$ contains an inaccessible cardinal. This is exactly the notion of fixed-point reflection we were trying to show earlier.
% viz http://euclid.colorado.edu/~monkd/m6730/gradsets12.pdf
%Thus a~Mahlo cardinal $\kappa$ is not only inaccessible, but also has $\kappa$ inaccessibles below it.

\

\cite{DrakeBook}
\begin{definition}{}\label{def:mahlo_equivalent}
The folllowing definitions are equivalent:
\bce[(i)]
\item $\kappa$ is Mahlo
\item $\kappa$ is weakly Mahlo and strong limit
% \item $\kappa$ is regular and the stationary sets below $\kappa$ form a~stationary subset of $\kappa$. wut?
\item The set $\{\lambda < \kappa : \lambda\mbox{ is inaccessible}\}$ is stationary in $\kappa$.
\item Every normal function on $\kappa$ has an inaccessible fixed point.
\ece
\end{definition}

\begin{proof}
$\bold{(i) \iff \bold{(ii)}}$
Let $\kappa_1$ be a mahlo cardinal and let $\kappa_2$ be a strong limit weakly Mahlo cardinal. We know from the definitions that the set $\{\lambda\ <\ \kappa:\ \lambda\mbox{ is inaccessible}\}$ is stationary in both $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, the only difference being that $\kappa_1$ is a strongly limit cardinal, but $\kappa_2$ would be limit from weak Mahloness, wasn't it for the fact that it is also strong limit. This eliminates the only difference between them and therefore $\kappa_1$ is also strong limit weakly Mahlo cardinal and $\kappa_2$ is Mahlo.

\

$\bold{(i) \then (iii)}$
We know that $\kappa$ is uncountable, regular, strong limit and that the set $S\ =\ \{\lambda\ <\ \kappa: \lambda\mbox{ is regular}\}$ is stationary in $\kappa$. 
We want to prove that $S'\ =\ \{\lambda\ <\ \kappa: \lambda\mbox{ is inaccessible}\}$ is thus also stationary in $\kappa$.

Since stationary set intersects every club set in $\kappa$, let $C$ be any such set. Let $D\ =\ \{ \lambda\ <\ \kappa:\ \lambda\mbox{ is strong limit}\}$. 
$D$ is a club set because TODO.
Since intersection of less than $\kappa$ club sets is a club set, $C \cap D \neq \emptyset$. 

TODO proc $\lambda\ =\ S \cap C \cap D$ je inaccessible?

%$\bold{(iii) \then (i)}$
%This is obvious since every inaccessible cardinal is regular, therefore every set of inaccessibles, that is presumed to be stationary in $\kappa$, is at the same time a set of regular cardinals.

$\bold{(iii) \then (iv)}$

Start with the proof of (\ref{th:refl_inaccessible}) and add the following:\\
$\kappa$ is Mahlo by the following contradiction. If not, there would be a~$C$ closed unbounded in $\kappa$ containing no inaccessible cardinals. By the hypothesis there is in inaccessible $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, C \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, C \rangle$.

\subsection{Indescribality} % Indescribality and Weakly Compact Cardinals

$\alpha$-Mahlo are the extreme of regular fixed-point axioms, they are about as high as we can get via normal functions and stationary sets.

Let's try a different strategy. Remember how we said that (Regular, Limit and) various Large cardinals are in a way all determined by being unreachable by a specific process of creating bigger cardinals from already available ones? 
%TODO neco jako reflecting reflection (uz u Mahlovejch teda)
TODO indescribable -- reflecting indescribability -- we can't reach $V$ by a $\Sigma_1^1$ formula, so there's some initial segment $V_\alpha$ that is also unreachable (we say indescribable) by the means of a ... formula


Let's recall complete reflection theorem first, consider the following:
\begin{equation}
\mbox{For every sentence $\varphi$, there is a limit ordinal $\alpha$ such that }\varphi^V_\alpha \iff \varphi
\end{equation}
We may also require that $\alpha < \beta$, where $\beta$ is an arbitrary ordinal given.

For the exact definition of $\Pi^m_n$ and $\Sigma^m_n$ see \ref{def:analytical_hierarchy}

\begin{definition}{($\Pi^m_n$-indescribable cardinal)}\label{def:pi_mn_indescribable}
We say that $\kappa$ is $\Pi^m_n$-indescribable iff for any $\Pi^m_n$ sentence $\varphi$ such that $V_\kappa \models \varphi$ there is an $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $V_\alpha \models \varphi$
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{($\Sigma^m_n$-indescribable cardinal)}\label{def:sigma_mn_indescribable}
We say that $\kappa$ is $\Sigma^m_n$-indescribable iff for any $\Sigma^m_n$ sentence $\varphi$ such that $V_\kappa \models \varphi$ there is an $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $V_\alpha \models \varphi$
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal, the following holds for any $n \in \omega$. $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable iff $\kappa$ is $\Sigma^1_n+1$-indescribable
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The forward direction is obvious, we can always add a spare quantifier over a type 2 variable to turn a $\Pi^1_n$ formula $\varphi$ into a $\exists P \varphi$ which is thus a $\Sigma^1_n+1$ formula.\footnote{Note that unlike in previous sections, $\varphi$ is now a sentence so we don't have to worry whether $P$ is free in $\varphi$.}

To prove the opposite direction, suppose that $V_\kappa \models \exists X \varphi(X)$ where $X$ is a type 2 variable and $\varphi$ is a $\Pi^1_n$ formula with one free variable of type 2. This means that there is a set $S \subseteq V_\kappa$ that is a witness of $\exists X \varphi(X)$, in other words, $\varphi(S)$ holds. We can replace every occurence of $X$ in $\varphi$ by a new predicate symbol $S$, this allows us to say that $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable (with respect to $\langle V_\kappa, \in, R, S \rangle$).
\footnote{A different yet interesting approach is taken by Tate in \ref{Tait_constructingcardinals}. He states that for $n\geq 0$, a formula of order $\leq n$ is called a $\Pi^n_0$ and a $\Sigma^n_0$ formula. Then a $\Pi^n_{m+1}$ is a formula of form $\forall Y \psi(Y)$ where $\psi$ is a $\Sigma^n_m$ formula and $Y$ is a variable of type $n$. Finally, a $\Sigma^n_{m+1}$ is the negation of a $\Pi^n_m$ formula. So the above holds ad definitio.}
\end{proof}

The above lemma tells us that we as long as we stay in the realm of type 1 and type 2 variables, we only need to classify indescribable cardinals with respect to $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\kappa$ be an ordinal. The following are equivalent.
\bce[(i)]
\item $\kappa$ is inaccessible
\item $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_0$-indescribable.
\ece
\end{theorem}

Note that $\Pi^1_0$ formulas are those that contain zero unbound quantifiers over type-2 variables, they are in fact first-order formulas. We have already shown in \ref{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc} that there is no way to reach an inaccesible cardinal via first-order formulas in $\sf{ZFC}$. We will now prove it again in for formal clarity.

\begin{proof}
TODO asi pridat alternativni definici nedosazitelnosti podle kan. 6.2?

The above theorem provides an easy way to show that every following large cardinal is also in inaccessible cardinal\footnote{That is because $\Pi^1_0$ formulas are included $\Pi^m_n$ formulas for $m \leq 1, n \leq 0$.}.


\begin{definition}{(Extension property)}
We say that a cardinal $\kappa$ has the \emph{extension property} iff for any $R \subseteq V_\kappa$ there is a~transitive set

It is a~conservative extension of Zermalo–Fraenkel set theory. Using forcing, one can prove equiconsistency of BGC and ZFC.

However if we go above the consistency strength of {\sf GB}, we can derive the existence of an inaccessible from such reflection (with a~second-order parameter).

%Note that since $\varphi$ may contain class variables, we need to specify the intended range of class variables in $V_\alpha$.

Take $\varphi$ to say ``there is no function from $\gamma \in \mx{ORD}$ cofinal in $\mx{ORD}$ and for every $\gamma \in \mx{ORD}$, $2^\gamma \in \mx{ORD}$''. Clearly, if $\varphi$ reflects at some $\alpha$, then $\alpha$ is inaccessible (here we use that the second-order variable range over $\power{V_\alpha} = V_{\alpha+1}$).
\end{proof}

As a~corollary we obtain:

\begin{Cor}\label{cor:refl01}
Second-order reflection in {\sf GB} implies the existence of an inaccessible cardinal.

\subsection{The Constructible Universe} % Reflection and the constructible universe

% TODO reflektovat muzeme jenom kardinaly konzistentni s V=L, proc????

% TODO Plagiat -- prepsat a~vysvetlit

The constructible universe, denoted $L$, is a cumulative hierarchy of sets, presented by Kurt Gödel in his 1938 paper \emph{The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalised Continuum Hypothesis}. For a technical description, see below. Assertion of their equality, $V=L$, is called the \emph{axiom of constructibility}. The axiom implies GCH and therefore also AC and contradicts the existence of some of the large cardinals, our goal is to decide whether those introduced earlier are among them.

On order to formally establish this class, we need to formalize the notion of definability first. 
\begin{definition}
We say that a set $X$ is \emph{definable} over a model $\langle M, \in \rangle$ if there is a first-order formula $\varphi$ together with parameters $p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M$ such that
\begin{equation}
X = \{x: x \in M \et \langle M, \in \rangle \models \varphi(x, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{(Sets definable in $M$)}\\
The following is a set of all definable subsets of a given set $M$, denoted Def($M$).
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
Def($M$) = \{\{y : x \in M \land \langle M, \in \rangle \models \varphi(y, u_1, \ldots, i_n) \} |\\
\mbox{ $\varphi$ is a~first-order formula, }p_1, \ldots, p_n \in M \}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

% Note that fle?

Now we can recursively build $L$.
\begin{definition}{(The Constructible universe)}\label{def:constructible_universe}
\bce[(i)]
\item
\begin{equation}
L_0 := \emptyset
\end{equation}

\item
\begin{equation}
L_{\alpha+1} := Def(L_{\alpha})
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}
L_{\lambda} = \bigcup_{\alpha < \lambda} L_{\alpha}\mbox{ If }\lambda\mbox{ is a~limit ordinal }
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}
L = \bigcup_{\alpha\in Ord} L_{\alpha}
\end{equation}
\ece
\end{definition}

Note that while $L$ bears very close resemblance to $V$, the difference is, that in every successor step of constructing $V$, we take every subset of $V_\alpha$ to be $V_{\alpha+1}$, whereas $L_{\alpha+1}$ consists only of definable subsets of $L_\alpha$. Also note that $L$ is transitive.

In order to

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:l_wo}
$L$ is well-ordered.\\

\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
Let $L$ be as in \ref{def:constructible_universe}.
\begin{equation}
L \models \sf{ZFC}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
TODO !!! (strucne) vit \cite{JechBook}[Theorem 13.3]
\bce[(i)]
\item \emph{Extensionality} (see \ref{def:extensionality}):\\
\emph{Extensionality} holds in $L$ because $\Delta_0$ formulas are absolute in transitive classes by \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute}, \emph{Extensionality} is $\Delta_0$ and $L$ is transitive.

\item \emph{Foundation} (see \ref{def:foundation})\\
Take a non-empty set $X$. Let $x \in X$ be a set such that $X \cap x = \emptyset$. $x$ is therefore defined by the formula $\varphi(x, y) = (x \cap y = \emptyset)$, so $x \in L$. $\varphi$ is $\Delta_0$ and therefore holds in $L$ by \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute}.

\item \emph{Pairing} (see \ref{def:pairing})\\
Since \emph{Pairin} is also $\Delta_0$, it holds in $L$ by the same argument as \emph{Extensionality} does by \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute}.

\item \emph{Union} (see \ref{def:union})\\
\emph{Union} is also $\Delta_0$, see \emph{Extensionality} and \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute}.

\item \emph{Power Set} (see \ref{def:powerset})\\
\emph{Power Set} also holds by \ref{lemma:delta_0_absolute}.

\item \emph{Infinity} (see \ref{def:infinity})\\

\begin{definition}{Constructibility}\\

\end{definition}

The following are a few interesting results that we won't prove but refer interested reader to appropriate resources instead.

\begin{definition}{(GCH)}\\
The following is called the Generalised Continuum Hypothesis, abbreviated as \emph{GCH}. It is an independent statement in $\sf{ZFC}$.
\begin{equation}
\mbox{\emph{GCH} iff }\aleph_{\alpha+1}=2^{\aleph_\alpha} \mbox{ for every ordinal }\alpha
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\begin{equation}
(L = V) \then GCH
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

This is proven in cite\{neco\} Gödel? Jech? Kunnen?

The reflection -- constructed as explained in the previous paragraph (!!! preformulovat !!!) -- with second-order parameters for higher-order formulas (even of transfinite type) does not yield transcendence over $L$.
