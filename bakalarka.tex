\section{Conclusion}
After establishing an intuitive concept of reflection, we have reviewed LÃ©vy's original proof of the equivalence of Replacement Schema and the Axiom of Infinity with his first-order reflection principle, we have then reformulated and proved the same result in contemporary terms. We have also shown that the same results can be obtained via axiom schemas stating the existence of regular fixed points on normal ordinal functions. After examining the concept of regular fixed points and seeing how it relates to stationary sets and Mahlo cardinals, we have introduced to notion of indescribable cardinal to see that Inaccessible, Mahlo and even Hyper-inaccessible cardinals are still significantly smaller than measurable cardinals, therefore concluding that this application of the reflection principle does not lead to transcendence over $L$.
