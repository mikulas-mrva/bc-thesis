\begin{abstract}
\noindent This thesis aims to examine relations between so called "Reflection Principles" and Large cardinals. Lévy has shown that Reflection Theorem is a sound theorem of ZFC and it is equivalent to Replacement Scheme and the Axiom of Infinity. From this point of view, Reflection theorem can be seen a~specific version of an Axiom of Infinity. This paper aims to examine the Reflection Principle and it's generalisations with respect to existence of Large Cardinals. This thesis will establish Inaccessible, Mahlo and Indescribable cardinals and their definition via reflection. A natural limit of Large Cardinals obtained via reflection are cardinals inconsistent with L. The thesis will offer an intuitive explanation of why this is the case.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

%Reflection principle is a kind of a theorem scheme stating the following:
% taky debilni formulace, ale co uz
\subsection{Motivation and Origin}
\begin{displayquote}
The Universe of sets cannot be uniquely characterized (i. e. distinguished from all its initial elements) by any internal structural property of the membership relation in it, which is expressible in any logic of finite of transfinite type, including infinitary logics of any cardinal order.
\end{displayquote}
\rightline{{\rm --- Kurt Gödel \cite{GodelWang}}}

To understand why do need reflection in the first place, let's think about infinity for a moment. In the intuitive sense, infinity is an upper limit of all numbers. But for centuries, this was merely a philosophical concept, closely bound to religious and metaphysical way of thinking, 
% aquinas -- summa, question 7
considered separate from numbers used for calculations or geometry. It was a rather vague concept. 
% neco o nekonecnech?
In ancient Greece, Aristotle's response to famous Zeno's paradoxes introduced the distinction between actual and potential infinity.
% zdroje
% http://www.iep.utm.edu/infinite/#SH1a
% (See Aristotle’s Physics, Book III, for his account of infinity.)
% viz A.W.Moore The Infinite -- je tam nejak reflexe?
He argued, that potential infinity is (in today's words) well defined, as opposed to actual infinity, which remained a vague incoherent concept. He didn't think it's possible for infinity to inhabit a bounded place in space or time, rejecting Zeno's thought experiments as a whole. 
% co Archimedes?
Aristotle's thoughts shaped western thinking partly due to Aquinas, who himself believed actual infinity to be more of a~metaphysical concept for describing God than a~mathematical property attributed to any other entity. In his Summa Theologica \footnote{Part I, Question 7, Article 3, Reply to Objection 1} he argues:
\begin{displayquote}
A geometrician does not need to assume a~line actually infinite, but takes some actually finite line, from which he subtracts whatever he finds necessary; which line he calls infinite.
\end{displayquote} % formalni citace?

Less than hundred years later, Gregory of Rimini wrote
\begin{displayquote}
If God can endlessly add a~cubic foot to a~stone–which He can–then He can create an infinitely big stone. For He need only add one cubic foot at some time, another half an hour later, another a~quarter of an hour later than that, and so on ad infinitum. He would then have before Him an infinite stone at the end of the hour.
\end{displayquote}
% citace (Moore 2001, 53)  "anti-Aristotelian backlash among the medievals"
Which is basically a~Zeno's Paradox made plausible with God being the actor. In contrast to Aquinas' position, Gregory of Rimini theoretically constructs an object with actual infinite magnitude that is essentially different from God.

\

% byl prvni cantor? jak presne to definoval Leibniz a~Newton?
Even later, in the 17th century, pushing the property of infinitness from the Creator to his creation, Nature, Leibniz wrote to Foucher in 1962:
% citace? zdroj: http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~rarthur/papers/LeibCant.pdf
\begin{displayquote}
I am so in favor of the actual infinite that instead of admitting that Nature abhors
it, as is commonly said, I hold that Nature makes frequent use of it everywhere,
in order to show more effectively the perfections of its Author. Thus I believe that
there is no part of matter which is not, I do not say divisible, but actually divided;
and consequently the least particle ought to be considered as a~world full of an
infinity of different creatures.
\end{displayquote}
But even though he used potential infinity in what would become foundations of modern Calculus and argued for actual infinity in Nature, Leibniz refused the existence of an infinite, thinking that Galileo's Paradoxon\footnote{zneni galileova paradoxu} is in fact a~contradiction. The so called Galileo's Paradoxon is an observation Galileo Galilei made in his final book "Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences".
He states that if all numbers are either squares and non–squares, there seem to be less squares than there is all numbers. On the other hand, every number can be squared and every square has it's square root. Therefore, there seem to be as many squares as there are all numbers. Galileo concludes, that the idea of comparing sizes makes sense only in the finite realm.
\begin{displayquote}
Salviati: So far as I see we can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all the numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes "equal," "greater," and "less," are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities. When therefore Simplicio introduces several lines of different lengths and asks me how it is possible that the longer ones do not contain more points than the shorter, I answer him that one line does not contain more or less or just as many points as another, but that each line contains an infinite number.
\end{displayquote}

% btw: http://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~rarthur/papers/Lairam.pdf  Leibniz’s Actual Infinite in Relation to his Analysis of Matter
Leibniz insists in part being smaller than the whole saying
\begin{displayquote}
Among numbers there are infinite roots, infinite squares, infinite cubes. Moreover, there are
as many roots as numbers. And there are as many squares as roots. Therefore there are as
many squares as numbers, that is to say, there are as many square numbers as there are
numbers in the universe. Which is impossible. Hence it follows either that in the infinite the
whole is not greater than the part, which is the opinion of Galileo and Gregory of St.
Vincent, and which I cannot accept; or that infinity itself is nothing, i.e. that it is not one and
not a~whole. % (LoC 9) je co?

structure so it contains more objects that behave like natural numbers and are based on an object (rather a~meta-object) that doesn't explicitly exist in the structure, but is closely related to it. This is the first instance of reflection. 
This paper will focus on taking this principle a~step further, extending Cantor's (or Zermelo–Fraenkel's, to be more precise) universe so it includes objects so big, they could be considered the universe itself, in a~certain sense. % dost vagni?


TODO dal asi smazat


% nemuzeme nikdy zachytit cele univerzum
% snaha udelat to stala za vznikem pojmu nekonecno, naivni teorie mnozin i jejich formalizaci
The original idea behind reflection principles probably comes from what could be informally called \textquote{universality of the universe}.
The effort to precisely describe the universe of sets was natural and could be regarded as one of the impulses for formalization of naive set theory.
If we try to express the universe as a~set $\{x  |  x = x\}$, a~paradox appears, because either our set is contained in itself and therefore is contained in a~set (itself again), which contradicts the intuitive notion of a~universe that contains everything but is not contained itself.

TODO ???

If there is an object containing all sets, it must not be a~set itself. The notion of class seems inevitable. Either directly the ways for example the Bernays–Gödel set theory, we will also discuss later in this paper, does in, or on a~meta–level like the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, that doesn't refer to them in the axioms but often works with the notion of a~universal class.
duet
Another obstacle of constructing a~set of all sets comes from Georg Cantor, who proved that the set of all subsets of a~set (let $A$ be the set and $\power (A)$ its powerset) is strictly larger that $A$. That would turn every aspiration to finally establish an universal set into a~contradictory infinite regression.\footnote{An intuitive analogy of this \emph{reductio ad infinitum} is the status of $\omega$, which was originally thought to be an unreachable absolute, only to become starting point of Cantor's hierarchy of sets growing beyond all boundaries around the end of the $19^{th}$ century}. We will use $V$ to denote the class of all sets. %Riemann!
%\newpage
From previous thoughts we can easily argue, that it is impossible to construct a~property that holds for $V$ and no set and is neither paradoxical like $\{x  |  x = x\}$ nor trivial. Previous observation can be transposed to a~rather naive formulation of the reflection principle:


\

(Refl) Any property which holds in $V$ already holds in some initial segment of $V$. 

\

To avoid vagueness of the term "property", we could informally reformulate the above statement into a~schema: 

\

For every first-order formula\footnote{this also works for finite sets of formulas \cite[p.~168]{JechBook}} $\varphi$ holds in $V \iff \varphi$ holds in some initial segment of $V$.

\

Interested reader should note that this is a~theorem scheme rather than a~single theorem. \footnote{If there were a~single theorem stating "for any formula $\varphi$ that holds in $V$ there is an initial segment of $V$ where $\varphi$ also holds", we would obtain the following contradiction with the second G{\"o}del's theorem: In ZFC, any finite group of axioms of ZFC holds in some initial segment of the universe. If we take the largest of those initial segments it is still strictly smaller than the universe and thus we have, via compactness, constructed a~model of ZFC within ZFC. That is, of course a~harsh contradiction. This also leads to an elegant way to prove that ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable.}

%Reflection is, among others, a~tool for constructing models of finitely axiomatizable theories within stronger frameworks of proving impossibility thereof. ?!

% viz kanamori
% jak to bylo s tim Godelem?
% nejdriv Montague ukazal ze ZFC neni konecne axiomatizovatelna "in a~strong sense"
%The first notion of reflection in our sense was formally stated and proved as a~theorem of ZF by Azriel L{\'e}vy in his 1960 article \emph{Axiomatic schemata of strong infinity in axiomatic set theory}\cite{Levy60a}. Only a~year later, this was followed by Richard Montague's \emph{Fraenkel's addition to the axioms of Zermelo}.

Reflection made it's first in set-theoretical appearance in G{\"o}del's proof of GCH in L  (citace Kanamori ? Lévy and set theory), but it was around even earlier as a~concept. G{\"o}del himself regarded it as very close to Russel's reducibility axiom (an earlier equivalent of the axiom schema of Zermelo's separation). Richard Montague then studied reflection properties as a~tool for verifying that Replacement is not finitely axiomatizable (citace?). a~few years later Lévy proved in \cite{Levy60a} the equivalence of reflection with Axiom of infinity together with Replacement in proof we shall examine closely in chaper 2.

\section{Levy's first-order reflection}\label{sec:fixed}

\subsection{Introduction}
This section will try to present Lévy's proof of a~general reflection principle being equivalent to Replacement and Infinity under ZF minus Replacement and Infinity.
We will first introduce a~few axioms and definitions that were a~different in Lévy's paper\cite{Levy60a}, but are equivalent to today's terms. We will write them in contemporary notation, our aim is the result, not history of set theory notation. 

Please note that Lévy's paper was written in a~period when Set theory was oriented towards semantics, which means that everything was done in a~model. All proofs were theodel that of $\sf{ZFC}$ was $V_\alpha$ (notated as $R(\alpha)$ at the time) for some cardinal $\alpha$, which means that $\alpha$ is a~inaccessible cadinal. Please bear in mind that this is vastly different from saying that there is an inaccessible $\alpha$ inside the model. This $V_\alpha$ is also referred to as $Scm^{\sf{Q}}(u)$, which means that $u$ ($u=V_\alpha$ in our case) is a~standard complete model of an undisclosed axiomatic set theory $\sf{Q}$ formulated in the "non-simple applied first order functional calculus", which is second-order theory is today's terminology, we are allowed to quantify over functions and thus get rid of axiom schemes. (Note that Lévy always speaks of "the axiom of replacement"). Besides placeholder set theory $\sf{Q}$ and $\sf{ZF}$, which the reader should be familiar with, theories $\sf{Z}$, $\sf{S}$, and $\sf{SF}$ are used in the text. $\sf{Z}$ is $\sf{ZF}$ minus replacement, $\sf{S}$ is $\sf{ZF}$ minus replacement and infinity, and finally $\sf{SF}$ is $\sf{ZF}$ minus infinity. "The axiom of subsets" is an older name for the axiom scheme of specification (and it's not a~scheme since we are now working in second order logic). Also note that universal quantifier does not appear, $\forall x \varphi (x)$ would be written as $(x) \varphi (x)$, the symbol for negation is "$\sim$".

Lévy then mentions Mahlo's arithmetic construction of cardinals, noting, that he will use similar strategy to build higher levels of strong axioms of infinity.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
\begin{definition}{Relativization}\label{def:relativization}
TODO (jech:161)
\end{definition}


\subsection{Lévy's Original Proof From 1960}\label{sec:Levy1960}
\begin{definition}{$N_0(\varphi)$}
\begin{equation}
\exists u (Scm^{\sf{S}}(u) \& x_1, \ldots , x_n \in u \then \varphi \iff \varphi^{u})
\end{equation}
where $\varphi$ is a~formula which does not contain free variables except $x_1, \ldots , x_n$.
\end{definition}

\

\begin{theorem}
In $\sf{S}$, the schema $N_0$ implies the Axiom of Infinity.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For any $\varphi$, $N_0$ gives us $\exists u Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$, which means that there is a~set $u$ that is identical to $V_\alpha$ for some alpha, so $\exists \alpha Scm^{\sf{S}}(V_\alpha)$.
We don't know the exact size of this $\alpha$, but we know that $\alpha \geq \omega$, otherwise $\alpha$ would be finite, therefore not closed under the powerset operation, which would contradict the axiom of powersets. 
In order to prove that it is a~model of $\sf{S}$, we would need to verify all axioms of $\sf{S}$ . We have already shown that $\omega$ is closed under the powerset operation. Foundation, extensionality and comprehension are clear from the fact that we work in $\sf{ZF}$\footnote{We only need to verify axioms that provide means of constructing larger sets from smaller to make sure they don't exceed $\omega$. Since $\omega$ is an initial segment of $ZF$, the axiom scheme of specification can't be broken, the same holds for foundation and extensionality.}, pairing is clear from the fact, that given two sets $A$, $B$, they have ranks $a$, $b$, without loss of generality we can assume that $a \leq b$, which means that $A \in V_a \in V_b$, therefore $V_b$ is a~set that satisfies the paring axiom: it contains both $A$ and $B$.

TODO vyhodit axiomy, staci vyrobit $\omega$
%TODO what about union?

We now want to prove that $V_\alpha$ leads to existence of an inductive set, which is a~set that satisfies $\exists A(\emptyset \in A \& \forall  x \in A ((x \cup \{ x\}) \in A))$. If we can find a~way to construct $V_\omega$ from any $V_\alpha$ satisfying $\alpha \geq \omega$, we are done. Since $\omega$ is the least limit ordinal, all we need is the following

\begin{equation}
\bigcap \{V_\kappa\ |\  \forall \lambda(\lambda < \kappa \then \exists \mu(\lambda < \mu < \kappa))\}
\end{equation}
because $V_\kappa$ is a~transitive set for every $\kappa$, thus the intersection is non-empty unless empty set satisfies the property or the set of $V_\kappa$s is itself empty.
\end{proof}

\

\begin{theorem}
In $\sf{S}$, the schema $N_0$ implies Replacement schema.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
TODO vysvetlit! (podle contemporary verze)

Let $\varphi(v, w)$ be a~formula wth no free variables except $v, w, x_1, \ldots, x_n$ where $n$ is any natural number.
Let $\chi$ be an instance of replacement schema for this $\varphi$:
\begin{equation}
\chi = \forall r, s, t(\varphi(r, s) \& \varphi(r, t) \then s = t) \then \forall x \exists y \forall w (w \in y \iff \exists v (v \in x \& \varphi(v, w)))
\end{equation}

\

We can deduce the following from $N_0$: 
\bce[(i)]
\item $x_1, \ldots, x_n, v, w \in u \then (\varphi \iff \varphi^{u}) $
\item $x_1, \ldots, x_n, v \in u \then (\exists w \varphi \iff (\exists w \varphi)^{u})$
\item $x_1, \ldots, x_n, x \in u \then (\chi \iff \chi^{u})$
\item $\forall x_1, \ldots, x_n \forall x (\chi \iff (\forall x_1, \ldots, x_n \forall x \chi)^{u})$
\ece

Note that (i), (ii), (iii) are obtained from instances of $N_0$ for $\varphi$, $\exists w \varphi$ and $\chi$ respectively.  % asi ne teda, spis je to postup dukazu, neco jako plan. % spis ne
From relativization we also know that $(\exists w \varphi)^{u}$ is equivalent to $\exists w (w \in u \& \varphi^{u})$.
Therefore (ii) is equivalent to $x_1, \ldots, x_n, v \in u \then (\exists w (w \in u \& \varphi^{u})$. 

If $\varphi$ is a~function ($ \forall r, s, t(\varphi(r, s) \& \varphi(r, t) \then r=t $)), then for every $x \in u$, which is also $x \subset u$ by $Scm^{\sf{S}}(u)$,
it maps elements of $x$ onto $u$. From the axiom scheme of comprehension\footnote{axiom of subsets in Levy's version}, we can find a~set of all images of elements of $x$. Let's call it $y$.
That gives us $x_1, \ldots, x_n, x \in u \then \chi$. By (iii) we get $x_1, \ldots, x_n, x \in u \then \chi^{u}$, closure of this formula is $(\forall x_1, \ldots, x_n \forall x \chi)^{u}$, 
which together with (iv) yields $\forall x_1, \ldots, x_n \forall x \chi$. By the means of specification we end up with $\chi$, which is all we need for now.

The following lemma is usually done in more parts, the first being with one formula and the other with $n$. We will only state and prove the generalised version for $n$ formulas, knowing that $n=1$ is just a specific case and the proof is exactly the same.

\begin{lemma}{Lemma}\label{lemma:reflection_lemma}
Let $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ be any formulas with $m$ parameters\footnote{For formulas with different number of parameters take for $m$ the highest number of parameters among given formulas. Add spare parameters to the other formulas so that $x$ remains the last parameter. That can be done in a~following manner: Let $\varphi'_i$ be the a~formula with k parameters, $k < m$. Let us set $\varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x) = \varphi'_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{k-1}, u_k, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)$, notice that $u_k, \ldots, u_{m-1}$ are spare variables added just for formal simplicity.}.

\exists x \varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x) \then (\exists x \in M) \varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)
\end{equation}
for every $u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1} \in M$.

\item Furthermore there is an ordinal $\alpha$ such that $M_0 \subset V_\alpha$ and the following holds for each $i \leq n$:
\begin{equation}
\exists x \varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x) \then (\exists x \in V_\alpha) \varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)
\end{equation}
for every $u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1} \in M$.
\ece
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We will simultaneously prove statements (i) and (ii), denoting $M^T$ the transitive set required by part (ii). Unless explicitly stated otherwise for specific steps, it is thought to be equivalent to $M$.

Let us first define operation $H(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1})$ that gives us the set of $x$'s with minimal rank satisfying $\varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)$ for given parameters $u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}$ for every $i \leq n$.

\begin{equation}
H_i(u_1, \ldots, u_n) = \{x \in C_i: (\forall z \in C)(rank(x) \leq rank(z))\}
\end{equation}
for each $i \leq n$, where
\begin{equation}
C_i = \{x: \varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)\} \mbox{ for $i \leq n$}
\end{equation}

\

Next, let's construct $M$ from given $M_0$ by induction. 
\begin{equation}
M_{i+1} = M_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^{n} \bigcup \{H_j(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}): u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1} \in M_i\}
\end{equation}
In other words, in each step we add the elements satisfying $\varphi(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)$ for all parameters that were either available earlier or were added in the previous step. 
For statement (ii), this is the only part that differs from (i). Let us take for each step transitive closure of $M_{i+1}$ from (i). In other words, let $\gamma$ be the smallest ordinal such that 
\begin{equation}
(M^T_i \cup \bigcup_{j=0}^{n} \{\bigcup\{H_j(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}): u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1} \in M_i\}\}) \subset V_\gamma
\end{equation}
Then the incremetal step is like so:
\begin{equation}
M^T_{i+1} = V_\gamma
\end{equation}
The final $M$ is obtained by joining all incremental steps together. 
\begin{equation}
M = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} M_i, \mbox{  }M^T = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty} M^T_i
\end{equation}

\

Let's try to construct a~set $M'$ that satisfies the same conditions like $M$ but is kept as small as possible. Assuming the Axiom of Choice, we can modify the process so that cardinality of $M'$ is at most $|M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$. Note that the size of $M'$ is determined by the size of $M_0$ an, most importantly, by the size of $H_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1})$ for any $i \leq n$ in individual levels of the construction. Since the lemma only states existence of some $x$ that satisfies $\varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)$ for any $i \leq n$, we only need to add one $x$ for every set of parameters but $H_i(u_1, \dots, u_{m-1})$ can be arbitrarily large. Since Axiom of Choice ensures that there is a~choice function, let $F$ be a~choice function on $\power(M')$. Also let $h_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}) = F(H_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}))$ for $i \leq n$, which means that $h$ is a~function that outputs an $x$ that satisfies $\varphi_i(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}, x)$ for $i \leq n$ and has minimal rank among all such witnesses. The induction step needs to be redefined to
\begin{equation}
M'_{i+1} = M'_i \cup \bigcup_j=0^n \{ h_j(u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1}): u_1, \ldots, u_{m-1} \in M'_i \}
\end{equation}
In every step, the amount of elements added in $M'_{i+1}$ is equivalent to the amount of sets of parameters the yielded elements not included in $M'_i$. So the cardinality of $M'_{i+1}$ exceeds the cardinality of $M'_i$ only for finite $M'_i$. It is easy to see that if $M_0$ is finite, $M'$ is countable because it was built from countable union of finite sets. If $M_0$ is countable or larger, cardinaly of $M'$ is equal to the cardinality of $M_0$.\footnote{It can not be smaller because $|M'_{i+1}|  \geq |M'_i|$ for every $i$. It may not be significantly larger because the maximum of elements added is the number of $n$-tuples in $M'_i$, which is of the same cardinality is $M'_i$. ((proc? Ramsey?))}
Therefore $|M'| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}{First-order Reflection}\label{theorem:first_order_reflection}
$\varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is a~first-order formula.
\bce[(i)]
\item For every set $M_0$ there exists $M$ such that $M_0 \subset M$ and the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^M(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \iff \varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
\end{equation}
for every $x_1, \ldots, x_n$.

\item For every set $M_0$  there is a~transitive set $M$, $M_0 \subset M$ such that the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^M(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \iff \varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
\end{equation}
for every $x_1, \ldots, x_n$.

\item For every set $M_0$ there is $\alpha$ such that $M_0 \subset V_{\alpha}$ and the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^{V_{\alpha}}(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \iff \varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
\end{equation}
for every $x_1, \ldots, x_n$.

\item Assuming the Axiom of Choice, for every set $M_0$ there is $M$ such that $M_0 \subset M$ and $|M| \leq |M_0| \cdot \aleph_0$ and the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\varphi^M(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \iff \varphi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
\end{equation}
for every $x_1, \ldots, x_n$.)
\ece
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let's prove (i) for one formula $\varphi$ via induction by complexity first. We can safely assume that $\varphi$ contains no quantifiers besides $\exists$ and no logical connectives other than $\neg$ and $\&$.
Assume that this $M$ is obtained from lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}. The fact, that atomic formulas are reflected in every $M$ comes directly from definition of relativization and the fact that they contain no quantifiers.\footnote{Note that this does not hold generally for relativizations to $M, E$, but only for relativization to $M, \in$, which is our case.}
The same holds for formulas in the form of $\varphi = \neg \varphi'$. Let us recall the definition of relativization for those formulas in \ref{def:relativization}.
\begin{equation}
(\neg \varphi_1)^M \iff \neg (\varphi_1^M)
\end{equation}
Because we can assume from induction that $\varphi'^M \iff \varphi'$, the following holds:
\begin{equation}
(\neg \varphi')^M \iff \neg (\varphi'^M) \iff \neg \varphi'
\end{equation}

The same holds for $\varphi = \varphi_1\mbox{ }\&\mbox{ }\varphi_2$. From the induction hypothesis we know that $\varphi_1^M \iff \varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2^M \iff \varphi_2$, which together with relativization for formulas in the form of $\varphi_1 \& \varphi_2$ gives us
\begin{equation}
(\varphi_1\mbox{ }\&\mbox{ }\varphi_2)^M \iff \varphi_1^M\mbox{ }\&\mbox{ }\varphi_2^M \iff \varphi_1\mbox{ }\&\mbox{ }\varphi_2
\end{equation}

\

Let's now examine the case when from the induction hypethesis, $M$ reflects $\varphi'(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x)$ and we are interested in $\varphi = \exists x \varphi'(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x)$.
The induction hypothesis tells us that 
\begin{equation}
\varphi'^M(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x) \iff \varphi'(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x)
\end{equation}
so, together with above lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}, the following holds:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\varphi(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x) \\
\iff \exists x \varphi'(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \in M) \varphi'(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \in M) \varphi'^M (u_1, \ldots, u_n, x) \\
\iff (\exists x \varphi'(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x))^M \\
\iff \varphi^M(u_1, \ldots, u_n, x)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Which is what we have needed to prove:

\

So far we have proven part (i) of this theorem for one formula $\varphi$, we only need to verify that the same holds for any finite number of formulas. This has in fact been already done since lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma} gives us $M$ for any (finite) amount of formulas. We can than use the induction above  to verify that it reflects each of the formulas individually. 

\

Now we want to verify other parts of our theorem. Since $V_\alpha$ is a~transitive set, by proving (iii) we also satisfy (ii). To do so, we only need to look at part (ii) of lemma \ref{lemma:reflection_lemma}. All of the above proof also holds for $M = V_\alpha$. To finish part (iv)

\end{proof}

\

\begin{theorem}
(Refl) is equivalent to (Infinity) $\&$ (Replacement) under ZFC minus (Infinity) $\&$ (Replacement)
\end{theorem}

\

\begin{proof}
Since \ref{theorem:first_order_reflection} already gives one side of the implication, we are only interested in showing the converse:

$\bold{(Refl) \then (Infinity)}$

Let us first find a~formula to be reflected that requires a~set $M$ at least as large as $V_\omega$.
Let us consider the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\varphi'(x) = \forall \lambda(\lambda < x \then \exists \mu(\lambda < \mu < x))
\end{equation}
Because $\varphi$ says "there is a~limit ordinal", if it holds for some $x$, the Infinity axiom is very easy to satisfy. But we know that there are limit ordinals in $\sf{ZF}$, therefore $\varphi = \exists x \varphi'(x)$ is a~valid statement. (Refl) then gives us a~set $M$ in which $\varphi^M$ holds, that is, a~set that contains a~limit ordinal. So the set of off limit ordinals is non-empty and because ordinals are well-founded, it has a~minimal element. Let's call it $\mu$.
\begin{equation}
\mu = \bigcap \{V_\kappa\ :\  \forall \lambda(\lambda < \kappa \then \exists \mu(\lambda < \mu < \kappa))\}
\end{equation}
We can see that $\mu$ is the least limit ordinal and therefore it satisfies (Infinity).


$\bold{(Refl) \then (Replacement)}$

Given a~formula $\varphi(x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n)$, we can suppose that it is reflected in any $M$ \footnote{Which means that for $x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n \in M$, $\varphi^M(x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n) \iff \varphi(x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n)$.}
What we want to obtain is the following:
\begin{equation}
\forall x, y, z (\varphi(x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n) \& \varphi(x, z, u_1, \ldots, u_n) \then y = z) \then
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\then \forall X \exists Y \forall y\ (y \in Y \iff \exists x (\varphi(x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n)\ \&\ x \in X ))
\end{equation}

We do also know that $x, y \in M$, in other words for every $X$, $Y\ =\ \{y\ |\ \varphi(x, y, u_1, \ldots, u_n)\}$ we know that $X \subset M$ and $Y \subset M$, which, together with the comprehension schema\footnote{Called the axiom of subsets in Levy's proof.} implies that $Y$, the image of $X$ over $\varphi$, is a~set.
Which is exactly the Replacement Schema we hoped to obtain.
\end{proof}

\

We have shown that $(Refl)$ for first-order formulas is a theorem of $\sf{ZF}$, which means that it won't yield us any large cardinals. We have shown that it can be used instead of the Axiom of Infinity and Replacement Scheme, but $\sf{ZF} + (Refl)$ is a conservative extension of $\sf{ZF}$. Besides being a starting point for more general and powerful statements, it can be used to show that $\sf{ZF}$ is not finitely axiomatizable. That is because $(Refl)$ gives a model to any finite number of (consistent) formulas. So if $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$ for any finite $n$ would be the axioms of $\sf{ZF}$, $(Refl)$ would always contain a model of itself, which would in turn contradict the Second Gödel's Theorem\footnote{See chapter \ref{section:inaccessibility} for further details.}.
Notice, that reflection in a way counterpart to compactness. Compactness argues that for an infinite\footnote{Countable?} set of sentences, if every finite subset yields a model, then so does the whole set. Reflection, on the other hand, says that while the whole set has no model in the underlying theory, every finite subset does have a model.

Also, notice how reflection can be used in ways similar to upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem. Since Reflection extends any set $M_0$ into a model of given formulas $\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n$, we can choose $M_0$ such that the final $M$ is at least as big as we need.\footnote{Too vague?}

\section{Large Cardinals} % used to be "... and Second-order Reflection"

In this chapter we aim to explore possible generalisations of $(Refl)$ for second- and higher-order formulas and use those to establish existence of various large cardinals. We will also argue whether there is a limit to the size of large cardinals accessible via generalised $(Refl)$.

To see that there is a way to transcend $\sf{ZF}$, let us briefly show how a model of $\sf{ZF}$ can be obtained in $\sf{ZF^2} + "second-order reflection"$\footnote{$\sf{ZF^2}$ is an axiomatization of $\sf{ZF}$ in second-order formulas, to be more rigorously established later.}. This will be more closely examined in section \ref{section:inaccessibility}.

We know that $\sf{ZF}$ can not be finitely axiomatized in first-order formulas, however if Replacement and Comprehension schemes can be substituted by second-order formulas, $\sf{ZF}$ becomes $\sf{ZF^2}$, which is finitely axiomatizable in second-order logic. Therefore if we take second-order reflection into consideration, we can obtain a set $M$ that is a model of $\sf{ZF^2}$. Therefore, second-order reflection. For now, we have left out the details of how exactly is first-order reflection generalised into stronger statements and how second-order axiomatization of $\sf{ZF}$ looks like. The purpose of this chapter is to try to answer these questions, as well as examine the relation of said reflection axioms to large cardinals.

We will now define reflection for second-order formulas.

%Let $\varphi(R)$ be a~$\Pi^n_m$-formula which contains only one free variable $R$ which is second-order. Given $R \sub V_\kappa$, we say that $\varphi(R)$ reflects in $V_\kappa$ if there is some $\alpha<\kappa$ such that:

%\mbox{If }(V_\kappa,\in, R)\models \varphi(R), \mbox{ then }(V_\alpha,\in, R\cap V_\alpha) \models \varphi(R\cap V_\alpha).

%\end{definition}



\subsection{Preliminaries}

But first, let's establish some elementary terms that will allow us to define the relevant large cardinals.

\begin{definition}(limit cardinal)\label{def:limit}
$kappa$ is a~\emph{limit cardinal} if it is $\aleph_\alpha$ for some limit ordinal $\alpha$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}(strong limit cardinal)\label{def:strong_limit}
$kappa$ is a~\emph{strong limit cardinal} if for every $\lambda < \kappa$, $2^\lambda < \kappa$
\end{definition}

\

We also need to rigorously define $\sf{ZF^2}$, the second-order axiomatization of $\sf{ZF}$ we have already used in the previous section. Let's take advantage of second-order variables and replace Replacement and Specification schemes with a single Replacement resp. Specification axiom. Lower-case letters represent first-order variables and upper-case $P$ represents a second-order variable.

% \cite{Shapiro87}
\begin{definition}{$\emph{Replacement}^2$}\label{def:replacement_2}\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\forall P (\forall x, y, z (P(x, y) \& P(x, z) \then y\ =\ z) \then
\\
\then (\forall x \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff \exists w \in x (P(w, z)))))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We will denote this axiom .
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{$\emph{Specification}^2$}\\
\begin{equation}
\forall P \forall x \exists y \forall z \, ( z \in y \iff [ z \in x \& P(z, x) ] )
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{$\sf{ZF^2}$}\\
Let $\sf{ZF^2}$ be a theory with all axioms identical with the axioms of $\sf{ZF}$ with the exception of $\emph{Replacement}$ and $\emph{Specification}$ schemes, which are replaced with $\emph{Replacement}^2$ and $\emph{Specification}^2$ respectively.

\subsection{Inaccessibility}\label{section:inaccessibility}
The inaccessible cardinal is the smallest of large cardinals\footnote{citation needed.}

\begin{definition}(weak inaccessibility)\label{def:weakly_inaccessible}
An uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ is \emph{weakly inaccessible} $\iff$ it is \emph{regular} and \emph{limit}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}(inaccessibility)\label{def:inaccessible} % nema byt vetsi nez \omega ?
An uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ is \emph{inaccessible} $\iff$ it is \emph{regular} and \emph{strongly limit}.
\end{definition}

Note that the above requirements could in fact be satisfied by $V_\omega$, except for the need for uncountability, which is being added exactly to leave out $V_\omega$ for practical purposes.\footnote{Informally, this clearly illustrates the fact stressed in section \ref{sec:introduction}, that large cardinals are obtained by similar way of thining that lead mathematicians to establish $\omega$ as an actual object.}

We will now show that the above notion is equivalent to the definition Levy uses in \cite{Levy60a}, which is, in more contemporary notation, the following:
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc}
The following are equivalent:\footnote{TODO skutecne plati na obe strany? viz http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1060005/h-kappa-a-model-of-all-the-axioms-of-zfc-for-kappa-not-inaccessible}
\bce
\item $\kappa$ in inaccessible
\item $\langle V_\kappa, \in \rangle \models \sf{ZFC}$
\ece
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let's first prove that if $\kappa$ is inaccessible, it is a model of $\sf{ZFC}$. We will do that by verifying the axioms of $\sf{ZFC}$ just like Kanamori does it in $\bold{1.2}$ in \cite{KanamoriBook}. Because $\kappa$ is a limit ordinal, there's no need for us to verify the Powerset, Foundation, Extensionality, Subset, Pairing and Union axioms and the Specification scheme. Thus we only have the Replacement Scheme to verify. 

Given an arbitrary set $x \in V_\kappa$ and a function $F: x \then V_\kappa$, we need to verify that $y = F[x]$ is indeed a set and that it is an element of $V_\kappa$. The fact that $F$ is a function imples that $|y|\ \leq |x|$. It follows from Specification that $y \subset V_\kappa$, which is still not exactly what we want. Let $\alpha < \kappa$ be the least ordinal such that $y \in V_\alpha$\footnote{TODO pozor -- jak vime ze takove alpha existuje?}, since $V_{\alpha+1} = \power(V_\alpha)$, $y \in V_{\alpha+1}$, together with $\alpha+1 < \kappa$ this means that $y \in V_\kappa$.

\

We will now show that if a set is a model of $\sf{ZFC}$, it is in fact an inaccessible cardinal. So let $V_\kappa$ be a model of $\sf{ZFC}$ which means that it is closed under the powerset operation, in other words:
\begin{equation}
\forall \lambda (\lambda < \kappa \then 2^{\lambda} < \kappa)
\end{equation}
which is exactly the definition of strong limitness. $\kappa$ is regular from the following argument by contradiction:\\
Let us suppose for a moment that $\kappa$ is singular. Therefore there is an ordinal $\alpha < \kappa$ and a function $F:\ \alpha \then \kappa$ such that the range of $F$ in unbounded in $\kappa$, in other words, $F[\alpha] \subseteq V_\kappa$ and $sup(F[\alpha])\ =\ \kappa$. In order to achieve the desired contradiction, we need to see that it is the case that $F[\alpha] \in V_\kappa$. Let $\varphi(x, y)$ be the following first-order formula:
\begin{equation}
F(x)\ =\ y
\end{equation}
Then there is an instance of  Axiom Schema of Replacement that states the following:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\forall x, y, z(\varphi(x, y) \& \varphi(x, z) \then y\ =\ z)) \then \\
\then (\forall x \exists y \forall z (z \in y \iff \exists w (\varphi(w, z)))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Which in turn means that there is a set $y = F[\alpha]$ and $y \in V_\kappa$, which is the contradiction with $sup(y) = \kappa$ we are looking for.
\end{proof}

\

The same holds for $\sf{ZF^2}$, the proof is very similar.
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc_2}
\begin{equation}
V_\kappa \models \sf{ZF^2} \iff \mbox{$\kappa$ is inaccessible}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\kappa$ is a strong limit cardinal because from $\sf{ZF^2}$ and the Powerset Axiom we know that for every $\lambda\ <\ \kappa$, we know that $2^{\lambda} < \kappa$.

$\kappa$ is also regular, because otherwise there would be an ordinal $\alpha$ and a function $F:\ \alpha \then \kappa$ with a range unbounded in $\kappa$. 
$\emph{Replacement}^2$ gives us a set $y\ =\ F[\alpha]$, so $y\ \in\ V_\kappa$, which contradicts the fact that $sup(y)\ =\ \kappa$. It can not be the case that $\kappa \in V_\kappa$.
\\

The other direction is exactly like the first part of above theorem \ref{theorem:inaccessible_models_zfc}.
\end{proof}
\\

The above makes clear that while the existence of inaccessibles is unprovable in $\sf{ZF}$ or $\sf{ZF^2}$, we now know that at least the smallest inaccessible cardinal exists in $\sf{ZF+(Refl^2)}$ because there is a set that models $\sf{ZF}$.

We have transcended $\sf{ZF}$, but that is just a start. What about cardinals inaccessible with respect to the new theory?

\begin{theorem}\label{th:refl_inaccessible}[Lévy] The following are equivalent:
\bce[(i)]
\item $\kappa$ is inaccessible.
\item For every $R \sub V_\kappa$ and every first-order formula $\varphi(R)$, $\varphi(R)$ reflects in $V_\kappa$.
\item For every $R \sub V_\kappa$, the set $C = \set{\alpha<\kappa}{\langle V_\alpha,\in,R \cap V_\alpha\rangle \el \langle V_\kappa,\in,R \rangle}$ is closed unbounded.
\ece
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let's start with (i) $\then$ (iii) in a~way similar to \cite{KanamoriBook}.\newline
The set $\set{\alpha<\kappa}{\langle V_\alpha,\in,R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \el \langle V_\kappa,\in,R\rangle}$ is clearly closed, it remains to show that it is also unbounded.
To do so, let $\alpha<\kappa$ be arbitrary. Define $\alpha_n < \kappa$ for $n\in\omega$ by recursion as follows:\newline
Set $\alpha_0=\alpha$. Given $\alpha_n < \kappa$ define $\alpha_{n+1}$ to be the least $\beta \geq \alpha_n$ such as 
whenever $y_1,\ldots,y_k \in V_{\alpha_n}$ and
$\langle V_{\kappa}, \in, R \rangle \models \exists v_0 \varphi [v_0, y_1, \ldots, y_k ]$
for some formula $\varphi$, there is an $x \in V_{\beta}$ such that $\langle V_{\kappa}, \in, R\rangle \models \varphi [x, y_1, \ldots, y_k]$.
\newline
Since $\kappa$ is inaccessible, $|V_{\alpha_n}| < \kappa$ and so $\alpha_{n+1} < \kappa$.\newline
Finally, set $\alpha = sup({\alpha_n | n \in \omega})$. 
Then $\langle$
 $V_ \alpha, \in, R  \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_{\kappa}, \in, R\rangle$ by the usual (Tarski) criterion for elementary substructure.
 \newline\newline
 The next part, proving $(iii) \then (ii)$, should be elementary since $C$ is closed unbounded, which means that it contains at least countably many elements but we need only one such $\alpha$ to satisfy (\ref{def:reflection_2}).
 \newline
 Finally, we shall prove that $(ii) \then (i)$. Since it obviously holds that $\kappa > \omega$, we have yet to prove that $\kappa$ is regular and a~strong limit. Let's argue by contradiction that it is regular. 
 If it wasn't, there would be a~$\beta < \kappa$ and a~function $F: \beta \implies \kappa$ with range unbounded in $\kappa$. Set $R = \{\beta\} \cup F$. By hypothesis there is an $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, R \rangle$. Since $\beta$ is the single ordinal in R, $\beta \in V_\alpha$ by elementarity. This yields the desired contradiction since the domain if $F \cap V_\alpha$ cannot be all of $\beta$.
 \newline\newline
 Next, let's see whether $\kappa$ is indeed a~strong limit, again by contradiction. If not, there would be a~$\lambda < \kappa$ such that $2^\lambda \geq \kappa$. Let $G: \power{\lambda} \implies \kappa$ be surjective and set $R = \{\lambda + 1\} \cup G$. By hypothesis, there is an $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, R \rangle$. $\lambda + 1 \in V_\alpha$ and so $\power{\lambda} \in V_\alpha$, but this is again a~contradiction.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:refl_mahlo}
$\kappa$ is Mahlo $\iff$ for any $R \subset V_\kappa$ there is an inaccessible cardinal $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, R \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, R \rangle$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Start with the proof of (\ref{th:refl_inaccessible}) and add the following:\\
$\kappa$ is Mahlo by the following contradiction. If not, there would be a~$C$ closed unbounded in $\kappa$ containing no inaccessible cardinals. By the hypothesis there is in inaccessible $\alpha < \kappa$ such that $\langle V_\alpha, \in, C \cap V_\alpha \rangle \prec \langle V_\kappa, \in, C \rangle$. By elementarity $C \cap \alpha$ is unbounded in $\alpha$. But then, $\alpha \in C$, which is the contradiction we need.
\end{proof}

Note that Mahlo cardinals were first described in 1911, almost 50 years before Lévy's reflection, which was heavily inspired by them.

\begin{comment}

\begin{lemma}
Every weakly compact cardinal is inaccessible
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\kappa$ b a~weakly compact cardinal. To show that $\kappa$ is regular, let us assume that $\kappa$ i the disjoint union
$\bigcup\{A_{\gamma}: \gamma < \lambda\}$ such that $\lambda < \kappa$ and $|A_{\gamma}| < \kappa$ for each $\gamma < \lambda$.
 We define a~partition $F: [\kappa]^2 \then \{0, 1\}$ as follows: $F(\{\alpha, \beta\}) = 0$ just in cas $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the same size $A_{\gamma}$. Obviously, this partition does not have a~homogenous set $H \subset \kappa$ of size $\kappa$.
 % todo lte, not implies
That $\kappa$ is a~strong limit cardinal follows from Lemma 9.4: (?? doplnit z jecha): If $\kappa \geq 2^{\lambda}$ for some $\lambda < \kappa$,
the because $2^{\lambda} \leq (\lambda^{+})^2$, we have $\kappa \leq (\lambda^{+})^2$ and hence $\kappa \leq (\kappa)^2$.

\begin{comment}

G{\"o}del–Bernays set theory, also known as Von Neumann–Bernays–G{\"o}del set theory is an axiomatic set theory that 
explicitly talks about proper classes as well as sets, which allows it to be finitely axiomatizable, albeit our version stated below contains one schema. It is a~conservative extension of Zermalo–Fraenkel set theory. Using forcing, one can prove equiconsistency of BGC and ZFC.
\newline
 
Bernays–G{\"o}del set theory contains two types of objects: proper classes and sets. The notion of set, usually denoted by a~lower case letter, is identical to set in ZF, whereas proper classes are usually denoted by upper case letters. The difference between the two is in a~fact, that 
proper classes are not members of other classes, sets, on the other hand, have to be members of classes.

\end{equation}
\ece
\end{definition}
%\newpage
The first five axioms are identical to axioms in ZF. \newline
Comprehension schema tells us, that proper classes are basically first-order predicates.
% opsano !!!!!
%Since {\sf GB}, G{\"o}del-Bernays' first-order theory with two sorts of variables (sets and classes), is finitely axiomatizable, there is no analogue of L{\'e}vy's theorem \ref{th:refl} provable in {\sf GB}. However if we go above the consistency strength of {\sf GB}, we can derive the existence of an inaccessible from such reflection (with a~second-order parameter).
...
 TODO Plagiat -- prepsat a vysvetlit
 
\begin{definition}\label{def:reflBG}
We say that $\varphi(R)$ with a~class parameter $R$ reflects if there is $\alpha$ such that
\begin{equation}
\varphi(R) \then (V_\alpha,V_{\alpha+1})\models \varphi(R\cap V_\alpha).
\end{equation} 
\end{definition}

%Note that since $\varphi$ may contain class variables, we need to specify the intended range of class variables in $V_\alpha$. As in the previous section, where the parameter $R$ ranged over entire $V_{\alpha+1}$, we postulate that the intended range of the class variables in Definition \ref{def:reflGB} is equal to $V_{\alpha+1}$.

\begin{theorem}\label{th:refl01}
There is a~second-order sentence $\varphi$ which is provable in {\sf GB} such that if $\varphi$ reflects at $\alpha$, i.e. if
\begin{equation}
\varphi \then (V_\alpha,V_{\alpha+1}) \models \varphi,
\end{equation}
then $\alpha$ is an inaccessible cardinal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Take $\varphi$ to say ``there is no function from $\gamma \in \mx{ORD}$ cofinal in $\mx{ORD}$ and for every $\gamma \in \mx{ORD}$, $2^\gamma \in \mx{ORD}$''. Clearly, if $\varphi$ reflects at some $\alpha$, then $\alpha$ is inaccessible (here we use that the second-order variable range over $\power{V_\alpha} = V_{\alpha+1}$).
\end{proof}

\

As a~corollary we obtain:

\begin{Cor}\label{cor:refl01}
Second-order reflection in {\sf GB} implies the existence of an inaccessible cardinal.

\subsection{Reflection and the constructible universe}


TODO reflektovat muzeme jenom kardinaly konzistentni s V=L, proc?

TODO Plagiat -- prepsat a~vysvetlit

$L$ was introduced by Kurt Gödel in 1938 in his paper \emph{The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalised Continuum Hypothesis} and denotes a~class of sets built recursively in terms of simpler sets, somewhat similar to Von Neumann universe $V$. Assertion of their equality, $V=L$, is called the \emph{axiom of constructibility}. The axiom implies GCH and therefore also AC and contradicts the existence of some of the large cardinals, our goal is to decide whether those introduced earlier are among them.

On order to formally establish this class, we need to formalize the notion of definability first:
{\color{red}
\begin{comment}

\begin{definition}[Definable sets]
\begin{equation}
Def(X) := \{\{{y | x }\in X \land \langle X, \in \rangle \models \varphi(y, z_1,\ldots,z_n) \} |\mbox{ }\varphi\mbox{ is a~first-order formula, }z_1,\ldots,z_n \in X \}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Now we can recursively build $L$.
\begin{definition}[The Constructible universe\newline]
\bce[(i)]
\item
\begin{equation}
L_0 := \emptyset
\end{equation}

\item
\begin{equation}
L_{\alpha+1} := Def(L_{\alpha})
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}
L_{\lambda} = \bigcup_{\alpha < \lambda} L_{\alpha}\mbox{ If }\lambda\mbox{ is a~limit ordinal }
\end{equation}
\item
\begin{equation}
L = \bigcup_{\alpha\in Ord} L_{\alpha}
